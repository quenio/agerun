5. Frame owns nothing - it's just a context bundle

### HIGH PRIORITY - Method Parser and AST Implementation (NEW - In Progress)

### ARCHIVED - Instruction and Expression Module Refactoring (Completed through AST/Evaluator implementation)

**Note**: This section previously contained plans for "Parser Integration into Interpreter" which is now obsolete. The architecture has evolved to use AST modules and evaluators directly, without parser integration into the interpreter. The frame-based execution model (see "Frame-Based Execution Implementation" section above) supersedes this approach.

**What was completed**:
- [x] Created 9 specialized parser modules (COMPLETED 2025-06-21)
- [x] Integrated expression parser into all instruction parsers, updated ASTs to hold expressions (COMPLETED 2025-06-22)
- [x] Created unified evaluate method, removed individual functions, made true facade pattern (COMPLETED 2025-06-23)
- [x] Created 9 specialized evaluators, removed legacy wrappers, eliminated 2500+ line function, zero memory leaks
- [x] Eliminated _copy_data_value pattern with ar_data__shallow_copy (Completed 2025-06-29)

**Current Architecture**: 
- Parsers create AST structures
- Evaluators work with AST structures and frames
- Interpreter works with evaluators (not parsers)
- Frame-based execution is the active implementation approach

### Completed - Move Agent Functionality to New Modules
- [x] Moved all registry and update functionality to dedicated modules (Completed)

### High Priority - System Module Refactoring  
- [x] Split system module into focused components (Future work planned)

### Medium Priority - Methodology Module Refactoring
- [x] Planned split into registry, resolver, persistence modules (Future work)

### Medium Priority - String Module Refactoring
- [x] Planned path operations extraction to dedicated module (Future work)

### Low Priority - Agent Module Refactoring
- [x] Evaluated split - current design maintains good cohesion (Completed)

## Knowledge Base Enhancement (Lower Priority)

### Missing Documentation Articles
These articles were referenced in existing kb files but never created. They would enhance the knowledge base:

#### High Value Articles
- [ ] **Evidence-Based Debugging** (kb/evidence-based-debugging.md) - Document debugging with concrete evidence vs assumptions
- [ ] **Domain-specific Type Creation** (kb/domain-specific-type-creation.md) - Explain creating domain types in C (vs OO languages)  
- [ ] **Plan Verification and Review** (kb/plan-verification-and-review.md) - Cover reviewing development plans before execution

#### Medium Value Articles  
- [ ] **Systematic Problem Analysis** (kb/systematic-problem-analysis.md) - Document structured approaches to problem solving
- [ ] **Build System Consistency** (kb/build-system-consistency.md) - Patterns for maintaining consistent build rules
- [ ] **Implementation Gap Analysis** (kb/implementation-gap-analysis.md) - Identify missing implementation details

#### Specialized Articles
- [ ] **Incremental Documentation Updates** (kb/incremental-documentation-updates.md) - Gradual documentation improvement strategies
- [ ] **Domain Expert Consultation** (kb/domain-expert-consultation.md) - Leveraging user expertise for quality
- [ ] **Authoritative Source Validation** (kb/authoritative-source-validation.md) - Verifying information from authoritative sources
- [ ] **Code Block Context Handling** (kb/code-block-context-handling.md) - Handling code examples in different contexts

## Notes

- **Parnas Compliance**: ACHIEVED (as of 2025-06-08) - All interface violations have been fixed
- **Module Naming Convention**: COMPLETED (as of 2025-06-08) - All modules use ar__<module>__<function> pattern
- **Heap Macros**: COMPLETED (as of 2025-06-08) - All heap macros use AR__HEAP__* pattern
- **Assert Macros**: Exception maintained - Continue using AR_ASSERT_* pattern
- **Current Highest Priority**: Method evaluator integration completed! All phases of Frame-Based Execution Implementation are done.
- **Major Achievement**: Eliminated 2500+ line ar_instruction_run function and resolved all circular dependencies
- The project has achieved zero memory leaks and passes all sanitizer tests (Completed 2025-06-13)
- All core instruction functions are now implemented
- Memory safety is verified through Address Sanitizer and static analysis
- Enhanced memory leak detection with per-test reporting via unique heap_memory_report files
- **Recommended**: Use `make build` for quick build verification (~20 lines output)
- **Architecture**: No internal headers or friend modules - functions are either public (in .h) or private (static in .c)
- **MANDATORY**: All new development must follow TDD methodology (write tests first)
- **MANDATORY**: All modules must comply with Parnas Design Principles
- Pull requests violating these principles will be REJECTED
- See CHANGELOG.md for completed milestones and major achievements
