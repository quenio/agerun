# Handle Discovery Gate logic for merge-settings workflow
# Usage: ./scripts/handle-discovery-gate-merge-settings.sh
#
# Purpose:
# - Implements conditional logic for merge-settings Discovery Gate
# - If no local file exists, skips all merge steps
# - Otherwise proceeds with merge workflow
#
# Returns:
# - Exit 0 if gate check completed successfully
# - Performs checkpoint updates as needed

        ./scripts/checkpoint-update.sh merge-settings $i

    echo "✅ Discovery gate: No merge required"
