/* 
 * This file is intentionally minimal since the assert module primarily 
 * consists of header-only macros. The implementation file exists to maintain 
 * consistency with the project structure where each module has both a .h 
 * and .c file.
 *
 * Future assertion enhancement functions (like custom assertion handlers,
 * log integration, or error reporting) would be implemented here.
