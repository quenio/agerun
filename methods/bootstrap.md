# Bootstrap Method

## Overview
The bootstrap method provides the foundation for system initialization in AgeRun. It will eventually be responsible for spawning essential system agents and orchestrating the startup sequence.

## Current Implementation
The bootstrap method currently:
- Handles wake and sleep messages properly
- Tracks its initialization state
- Sends status messages to the system

## Future Functionality
Once the system can load methods from files (TDD Cycle 5), the bootstrap method will:
- Spawn the echo agent for basic communication
- Initialize other system agents as needed
- Orchestrate the full system startup sequence

## Method Code
```agerun
memory.is_wake := if(message = "__wake__", 1, 0)
memory.is_sleep := if(message = "__sleep__", 1, 0)
memory.is_special := memory.is_wake + memory.is_sleep
memory.initialized := if(memory.is_wake > 0, 1, memory.initialized)
send(0, if(memory.initialized > 0, "Bootstrap initialized", "Bootstrap ready"))
```

## Planned Enhancement (Cycle 5)
```agerun
# Once system can load methods from files:
memory.echo_id := spawn("echo", "1.0.0", context)
send(memory.echo_id, context)
```

## Testing
The bootstrap method is tested in `methods/bootstrap_tests.c` which verifies:
- Proper handling of wake messages
- Memory initialization
- No memory leaks

Additional tests for spawning functionality are ready but commented out, awaiting Cycle 5 implementation.

## Usage
The bootstrap method will be loaded by the executable during initialization to orchestrate the system startup process.
