# Bootstrap Method

## Overview
The bootstrap method provides the foundation for system initialization in AgeRun. It will eventually be responsible for spawning essential system agents and orchestrating the startup sequence.

## Current Implementation
The bootstrap method currently:
- Sends a status message to the system
- Acts as a placeholder for future initialization logic

## Future Functionality
In TDD Cycle 7, the bootstrap method will:
- Spawn the echo agent immediately upon creation
- Initialize other system agents as needed
- Orchestrate the full system startup sequence

## Method Code
```agerun
memory.status := "Bootstrap ready"
send(0, memory.status)
```

## Planned Enhancement (Cycle 7)
```agerun
# Bootstrap will spawn echo immediately:
memory.echo_id := spawn("echo", "1.0.0", context)
send(memory.echo_id, "Bootstrap system initialized")
```

## Testing
The bootstrap method is tested in `methods/bootstrap_tests.c` which verifies:
- Status message sending
- No memory leaks

Additional tests for spawning functionality are ready but commented out, awaiting Cycle 7 implementation.

## Usage
The bootstrap method will be loaded by the executable during initialization to orchestrate the system startup process.
