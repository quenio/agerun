  - ✅ Reordered `ar_system_shutdown()` to call `ar_agency_reset()` before disabling
  - ✅ Ensures proper cleanup of all agents before marking system as uninitialized
- ✅ All tests now pass with zero memory leaks
- ✅ Completed agency module refactoring tasks:
  - ✅ Moved agent registry ownership from agent module to agency module
  - ✅ Removed circular dependency between agent and agent_registry modules
  - ✅ Created comprehensive documentation for agency module (agerun_agency.md)
  - ✅ Agency facade now properly owns and manages the registry

### 2025-06-06
- ✅ Completed agent module interface cleanup to fix Parnas violations:
  - ✅ Removed `ar_agent_get_agents_internal()` - moved to agent_registry
  - ✅ Removed `ar_agent_get_next_id_internal()` - moved to agent_registry
  - ✅ Removed `ar_agent_set_next_id_internal()` - moved to agent_registry
  - ✅ Removed `ar_agent_get_internal()` - no longer needed
  - ✅ Added `ar_agent_get_registry()` for agency/store access
  - ✅ Kept `ar_agent_reset_all()` for agency shutdown needs
- ✅ Implemented dynamic agent registry with no artificial limits:
  - ✅ Replaced MAX_AGENTS (1024) limit with dynamic list/map structure
  - ✅ Used string-based IDs in list for persistent map keys
  - ✅ Achieved O(1) agent lookups with insertion-order iteration
- ✅ Updated agent module to use registry internally
- ✅ Updated agent_store and agency to use registry API
- ✅ Maintained zero memory leaks throughout refactoring
