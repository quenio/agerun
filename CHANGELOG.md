# AgeRun CHANGELOG

## 2025-10-15
- **TDD Cycle 7 Plan Review - Fixture Infrastructure (Iterations 0.1-0.8)**: Completed comprehensive review of test fixture infrastructure planning following strict TDD methodology; **Plan Refinement**: Split iterations 0.6 and 0.7 into sub-iterations (0.6.1/0.6.2, 0.7.1/0.7.2) following TDD GREEN minimalism principle - first iteration tests non-NULL return, second iteration verifies actual registration; **Pattern Applied**: Matching the pattern established in user feedback during session - temporary manual cleanup in .1 iterations to avoid memory leaks, removed in .2 iterations when registration takes ownership; **Review Status Tracking**: Added REVIEWED markers to iterations 0.1-0.8, PENDING REVIEW markers to iterations 1.1-4 enabling resumable multi-session review workflow; **Files Modified**: plans/tdd_cycle_7_plan.md (added review status to all 16 iterations), TODO.md (marked plan as created, added review completion task, added implementation roadmap); **Plan Structure**: Iteration 0 creates ar_send_evaluator_fixture module (8 iterations: fixture creation, evaluator/frame/delegation/agency helpers, delegate/agent registration with .1/.2 splits, existing test refactoring), Iterations 1-4 implement actual routing (1.1-1.5 delegate routing with incremental assertions, 2 agent routing verification, 3 error handling, 4 documentation); **Key Achievement**: Complete planning phase with proper TDD iteration breakdown, ready for implementation execution following plan document order

## 2025-10-13
- **TDD Cycle 6.5 - Complete Delegate Message Queue Infrastructure**: Completed all 14 iterations implementing message queue functionality in both ar_delegate and ar_delegation modules following strict TDD methodology with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles; **Architecture**: Two-layer design - ar_delegate provides queue primitives (send/has_messages/take_message), ar_delegation provides ID-based routing (send_to_delegate/delegate_has_messages/take_delegate_message) following ar_agency pattern exactly; **Implementation**: Iterations 1-6 added own_message_queue field (ar_list) to ar_delegate_t with proper ownership semantics (take ownership when queuing, drop ownership when taking), Iterations 7-14 added delegation layer routing with registry lookups delegating to ar_delegate functions; **Files Modified**: modules/ar_delegate.{h,c} (3 queue functions), modules/ar_delegation.{h,c,md} (3 routing functions), modules/ar_delegate_tests.c (6 BDD tests), modules/ar_delegation_tests.c (8 BDD tests with integration scenarios); **Quality Metrics**: Clean build (1m 31s), 78 tests passing, zero memory leaks (delegate: 46 allocations, delegation: 154 allocations, 0 bytes leaked), make check-logs passes with deep analysis clean, documentation validated; **Test Coverage**: 9 delegate tests + 11 delegation tests covering complete queue lifecycle, ownership transfer, error handling, non-existent delegate cases, and queued message cleanup; **Key Achievement**: Complete message queue infrastructure ready for TDD Cycle 7 (system-level ID routing) with proper ownership semantics and comprehensive test coverage

## 2025-10-12
- **API Cleanup - ar_interpreter Module**: Removed obsolete `ar_interpreter__create(log)` function which was dead code always returning NULL; **Rationale**: With agency and delegation now mandatory parameters, the old single-parameter create() function could never succeed; **Refactoring**: Renamed `ar_interpreter__create_with_agency()` → `ar_interpreter__create()` for cleaner, more consistent API; **Files Modified**: 5 files (ar_interpreter.{h,c}, ar_system.c, ar_interpreter_fixture.c, ar_interpreter_tests.c); **Impact**: Eliminated 14 lines of dead code, simplified API surface; **Quality Metrics**: Clean build (1m 31s), 78 tests passing, zero memory leaks
- **Delegate System Phase 2 - Evaluator Delegation Parameter Propagation**: Completed preparatory refactoring to propagate delegation parameter through entire evaluator chain; **Architecture**: Delegation now flows from ar_system → ar_interpreter → ar_method_evaluator → ar_instruction_evaluator → ar_send_instruction_evaluator enabling ID-based message routing (ID >= 0: agency, ID < 0: delegation); **Implementation**: Updated create function signatures across all evaluators, added delegation to struct fields, updated all test files to pass delegation parameter; **Files Modified**: 17 files total - Production code (10 files): ar_send_instruction_evaluator.{h,zig}, ar_instruction_evaluator.{h,zig}, ar_method_evaluator.{h,zig}, ar_interpreter.{h,c}, ar_system.c, ar_evaluator_fixture.{h,c}; Test code (7 files): ar_send_instruction_evaluator_tests.c, ar_instruction_evaluator_tests.c, ar_instruction_evaluator_dlsym_tests.c, ar_method_evaluator_tests.c, ar_interpreter_fixture.c, ar_interpreter_tests.c; **Documentation**: Updated ar_method_evaluator.md and ar_instruction_evaluator.md with new signatures showing agency and delegation parameters; **Quality Metrics**: Clean build (1m 36s), 78 tests passing, zero memory leaks, make check-docs passes; **Result**: Infrastructure ready for TDD Cycle 7 to implement actual ID-based routing logic in send evaluator

- **Proxy System TDD Cycle 4**: Created ar_delegate_registry module following ar_agent_registry pattern for architectural consistency; **Architectural Decision**: Separate registry module instead of embedding in ar_system maintains separation of concerns and follows established patterns; **Implementation**: RED phase (stub returns false causing assertion failure), GREEN phase (8 public functions with list+map internal structure, 333 lines), REFACTOR phase (6 comprehensive tests with BDD structure, zero memory leaks, 185-line module documentation with 7 real code examples); **Files Created**: modules/ar_delegate_registry.h, modules/ar_delegate_registry.c, modules/ar_delegate_registry_tests.c, modules/ar_delegate_registry.md; **Key Design**: Registry OWNS proxies (unlike agent_registry), proper opaque type pattern, 100% API coverage; **Result**: Complete registry infrastructure ready for ar_system integration with zero leaks and excellent test coverage
