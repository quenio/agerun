# AgeRun CHANGELOG

## 2025-10-18 (Session 2g - Knowledge Base Integration)

- **Establish Command Orchestrator Checkpoint Patterns in Knowledge Base**

  Completed comprehensive 11-step new-learnings workflow integrating critical checkpoint and orchestrator patterns discovered during Session 2g refactoring work.

  **Session 2g Learning Synthesis**:
  1. Checkpoint updates belong in orchestrator, not scripts
  2. Two-level hierarchy: checkpoint steps (tracked) vs operations (documented)
  3. Helper scripts must be completely decoupled for reusability
  4. Checkpoint markers must wrap complete logical units
  5. Orchestrator clarity requires showing all operations inline

  **KB Articles Created (3 new patterns)**:
  - [Command Orchestrator and Checkpoint Separation](kb/command-orchestrator-checkpoint-separation.md) - Orchestrator handles checkpoints; scripts handle domain work
  - [Checkpoint Operations and Steps Hierarchy](kb/checkpoint-operations-and-steps-hierarchy.md) - Two-level tracking hierarchy with clear boundaries
  - [Helper Script Reusability Pattern](kb/helper-script-reusability-pattern.md) - Complete decoupling for cross-workflow reuse

  **KB Articles Updated (4 existing cross-referenced)**:
  - command-orchestrator-pattern.md - Added references to new checkpoint separation patterns
  - checkpoint-sequential-execution-discipline.md - Linked to hierarchy and separation patterns
  - command-helper-script-extraction-pattern.md - Connected to reusability pattern
  - kb/README.md - Indexed all 3 new KB articles in Knowledge Management section

  **Commands Enhanced (3 with new KB references)**:
  - check-logs.md - Added command orchestrator pattern reference
  - build.md - Added checkpoint separation pattern reference
  - AGENTS.md - Updated checkpoint wrapper scripts section with hierarchy and separation details

  **Quality Validation**:
  - make check-docs: All documentation valid (587 files checked)
  - make check-commands: All commands pass quality gates (average 99.4%)
  - Cross-references: Bidirectional KB links established

  **Impact**: Codifies checkpoint and orchestrator patterns for systematic integration across future commands and ensures proper helper script decoupling for maximum reusability.

  **Commits**: 6 total (f8e4210 through 0451660) - Initial Session 2g refactoring plus new-learnings integration

- **Decouple Documentation Validation Helper Scripts from Checkpoint Tracking**

  Refactored check-docs command to follow command orchestrator pattern with proper separation of concerns between helper scripts and checkpoint management.

  **Problem**: Helper scripts (validate-docs.sh, preview-doc-fixes.sh, apply-doc-fixes.sh) contained embedded checkpoint-update calls, coupling them to checkpoint tracking and preventing reuse in other workflows.

  **Solution**: Applied proper orchestrator pattern discipline:
  1. **Removed checkpoint coupling from scripts** - Helper scripts now focus on single responsibility, no checkpoint calls
  2. **Updated command orchestrator** - check-docs.md now handles all checkpoint updates and tracking
  3. **Aligned checkpoint markers** - Wrapped each of 5 checkpoint steps with proper [CHECKPOINT START/END] markers
  4. **Documented orchestration clearly** - Command shows 15 operations grouped into 5 logical checkpoint steps with explicit boundaries

  **Checkpoint Steps Defined**:
  - Step 1: Validate Docs (validate-docs.sh + checkpoint-update 1)
  - Step 2: Preview Fixes (conditional-flow + preview-doc-fixes.sh + checkpoint-update 2)
  - Step 3: Apply Fixes (apply-doc-fixes.sh + checkpoint-update 3)
  - Step 4: Verify Resolution (verify-docs.sh + checkpoint-update 4 + gate)
  - Step 5: Commit and Push (commit-docs.sh + checkpoint-update 5)

  **Changes**:
  - Modified: 3 helper scripts (removed checkpoint calls)
  - Modified: check-docs.md command (proper orchestration with markers)
  - Commits: f8e4210, 88b08a8, 90c0ae7, c38b21a, f300816

## 2025-10-18 (Session 2f)

- **Integrate Command Orchestrator Pattern Learnings into Knowledge Base**

  Completed comprehensive 14-step new-learnings workflow documenting session insights on command orchestrator pattern and helper script extraction discipline.

  **Session Learnings Captured**:
  1. Command orchestrator pattern prevents wrapper script anti-patterns
  2. Each 10+ line shell block should extract to focused helper script
  3. User feedback consistently identifies extraction violations
  4. Pattern violations propagate across related commands
  5. Checkpoint enforcement requires three levels: startup, execution, completion

  **Knowledge Base Updates (3 articles)**:
  - command-orchestrator-pattern.md - Added check-naming real-world refactoring example
  - command-helper-script-extraction-pattern.md - Added check-naming and new-learnings examples
  - checkpoint-workflow-enforcement-pattern.md - Added three-level enforcement implementation

  **Command Updates (3 commands)**:
  - compact-changes.md - Added orchestrator pattern reference
  - compact-guidelines.md - Added orchestrator pattern reference
  - compact-tasks.md - Added orchestrator pattern reference

  **Verification**:
  - All documentation validated with make check-docs
  - All command references verified and working
  - Integration verification passed all quality gates
  - Comprehensive session analysis with multi-pass learning extraction

  **Changes**:
  - Created: 3 KB article examples from session work
  - Modified: 3 command files with orchestrator pattern references
  - All work committed and pushed (9061616)

- **Extract new-learnings Checkpoint Detection to Focused Helper Script**

  Extracted multi-line bash logic from new-learnings command into focused helper script per command-helper-script-extraction-pattern.md.

  **Problem**: The new-learnings command had embedded logic (10+ lines) for checkpoint detection directly in the command documentation:
  - Checkpoint existence checking logic was embedded in markdown
  - Conditional branching for resume/fresh start was not extracted
  - Violated command-helper-script-extraction-pattern.md extraction discipline

  **Solution**: Applied proper extraction discipline:
  1. **Created check-new-learnings-checkpoint.sh** - Focused helper script for checkpoint status detection
  2. **Refactored new-learnings.md** - Command file now calls helper script instead of embedding logic
  3. **Simplified documentation** - Cleaner command file while maintaining all orchestration visibility

  **Changes**:
  - Created: scripts/check-new-learnings-checkpoint.sh (single responsibility: check checkpoint status)
  - Modified: .opencode/command/ar/new-learnings.md (uses helper script)

  **Benefits**:
  - **Reusability**: Helper script can be used independently or in other commands
  - **Testability**: Script can be tested in isolation
  - **Clarity**: Command documentation cleaner while remaining the orchestrator
  - **Compliance**: Follows extraction discipline: one script per shell block (10+ lines)

- **Refactor check-naming Command to Follow Command Orchestrator Pattern**

  Refactored the check-naming.md command file to follow the command orchestrator pattern per command-helper-script-extraction-pattern.md, extracting multi-line bash logic into focused helper scripts and making all workflow orchestration visible in the command documentation.

  **Problem**: The check-naming command had embedded multi-line bash blocks (10+ lines) directly in the command documentation:
  - Run naming check logic was 10+ lines embedded in markdown
  - Conditional flow logic was 10+ lines embedded in markdown
  - Violated command-helper-script-extraction-pattern.md requirements for extracting complex logic
  - Command file was not cleanly showing orchestration

  **Solution**: Applied proper extraction discipline per command-helper-script-extraction-pattern.md:
  1. **Created run-naming-check.sh** - Extracted check execution and violation capture (was embedded, 10 lines)
  2. **Created check-naming-conditional-flow.sh** - Extracted conditional flow logic (was embedded, 10 lines)
  3. **Refactored check-naming.md** - Command file now shows orchestration with calls to focused helper scripts
  4. **Verified checkpoint workflow** - Tested end-to-end with conditional step skipping (no violations case)

  **Changes**:
  - Created: scripts/run-naming-check.sh (single responsibility: run check and capture violations)
  - Created: scripts/check-naming-conditional-flow.sh (single responsibility: implement conditional flow)
  - Modified: .opencode/command/ar/check-naming.md (simplified with script references)
  - Removed: "Checkpoint Wrapper Scripts" section (command IS the orchestrator)

  **Benefits**:
  - **Reusability**: Helper scripts can be reused in other commands or run independently
  - **Testability**: Each script can be tested in isolation
  - **Clarity**: Command documentation remains orchestrator showing all logic
  - **Compliance**: Follows extraction discipline: one script per shell block (10+ lines)
  - **Maintainability**: Simple focused scripts instead of embedded logic
  - **Documentation**: Workflow logic visible in markdown (no hidden scripts to read)

## 2025-10-18 (Session 2e)

- **Extract check-commands Embedded Scripts into Reusable Modules**

  Extracted all bash shell blocks from the check-commands.md command into separate, focused scripts in the scripts/ directory for better reusability and maintainability.

  **Problem**: The check-commands workflow had 5 embedded shell scripts (each 300-900 lines of logic) directly in the markdown file. This made them:
  - Difficult to maintain and update
  - Impossible to reuse in other commands that might need similar validation logic
  - Hard to test independently
  - Cluttered the command documentation

  **Solution**: Extracted each shell block into its own script file with a clear purpose:
  1. **scan-commands.sh** - Scans for all command files in .opencode/command/ar
  2. **validate-command-structure.sh** - Runs structure validation via check_commands.py
  3. **calculate-command-scores.sh** - Extracts and analyzes quality scores
  4. **identify-command-issues.sh** - Analyzes command distribution and identifies problems
  5. **generate-command-report.sh** - Generates final quality report

  **Changes**:
  - Created 5 new scripts in scripts/ directory, each with a single responsibility
  - Updated check-commands.md to call extracted scripts instead of embedding logic
  - All scripts are executable and follow project conventions
  - 5 files created, 1 file modified
  - Reduced check-commands.md complexity while maintaining functionality

  **Benefits**:
  - **Reusability**: Scripts can be used by other commands that need similar validation
  - **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused scripts are easier to update and debug
  - **Clarity**: Command documentation is now cleaner and easier to read
  - **Testability**: Scripts can be executed and tested independently
  - **Naming Convention**: All scripts include "command" term in name for clarity

## 2025-10-18 (Session 2d)

- **Complex Command Pattern Migration: next-priority and next-task**

  Migrated next-priority and next-task commands from simple single-script pattern to complex multi-step pattern, aligning with other complex commands like create-plan and execute-plan.

  **Problem**: These commands had more sophisticated workflows than typical simple commands, but were using the run-*.sh script pattern designed for simple ≤15-step commands. This made it harder to customize their execution and didn't match the pattern used for similar complex commands.

  **Solution**: Converted both commands to define their steps directly in the markdown files:
  1. **next-priority** (3 steps):
     - Read Context: Load AGENTS.md and TODO.md
     - Analyze Priorities: Apply KB protocols and quantify metrics
     - Generate Recommendation: Provide justification and wait for user feedback

  2. **next-task** (3 steps):
     - Read Context: Understand project state
     - Check Task Sources: Check session todos and TODO.md
     - Discover Next Task: Identify and present the next work item

  **Changes**:
  - Rewrote next-priority.md and next-task.md with step-by-step instructions
  - Updated to use checkpoint wrapper scripts (init-checkpoint, require-checkpoint, update-checkpoint, complete-checkpoint)
  - Removed run-next-priority.sh and run-next-task.sh scripts
  - 2 files changed, 305 insertions/deletions

  **Benefits**:
  - Consistency: Now follows same pattern as other complex commands
  - Flexibility: Steps can be customized without modifying scripts
  - Clarity: Each step has clear instructions and examples
  - Maintainability: Command logic is in markdown, not scattered across scripts

## 2025-10-18 (Session 2c)

- **Command Documentation Clarity Improvements**

  Restructured all 14 simple checkpoint commands to prevent accidental manual checkpoint initialization, which was causing checkpoint state conflicts.

  **Problem**: Command documentation showed both manual checkpoint initialization commands and the script entry point, creating ambiguity about the correct execution path. This led to mistakes where developers manually ran `make checkpoint-init` before running the script, causing checkpoint state conflicts.

  **Solution**: Reorganized documentation structure in all 14 command files with:
  1. **⚠️ CRITICAL Warning Section** - Explicit instruction: "DO NOT manually initialize checkpoints"
  2. **Quick Start Section** - Single clear instruction: "Just run the script"
  3. **Troubleshooting Section** - Manual commands moved here, clearly marked as emergency-only

  **Commands Updated** (14 total):
  - check-docs, check-naming, next-priority, next-task
  - build, build-clean, run-exec, run-tests
  - analyze-exec, analyze-tests, sanitize-exec, sanitize-tests
  - tsan-exec, tsan-tests

  **Changes**: 14 files updated with 238 insertions/deletions

  **Benefits**:
  - Clear intent: No ambiguity about which commands to run
  - Error prevention: Warnings prevent the specific mistake pattern
  - Better UX: Quick Start section makes correct path obvious
  - Professional: Troubleshooting clearly separated from normal workflow

## 2025-10-18 (Session 2b)

- **Complex Command Wrapper Script Integration**

  Updated all 17 complex commands (>15 steps with custom logic) to use standardized checkpoint wrapper scripts instead of direct make commands, maintaining their sophisticated documentation while centralizing checkpoint operations.

  **Problem**: Complex commands used direct `make checkpoint-*` commands scattered throughout documentation, making it harder to maintain and update checkpoint behavior across the command suite.

  **Solution**: Replaced all direct make commands with standardized wrapper scripts:
  - `make checkpoint-status CMD=...` → `./scripts/checkpoint-status.sh ...`
  - `make checkpoint-update CMD=...` → `./scripts/checkpoint-update.sh ...`
  - `make checkpoint-gate CMD=...` → `./scripts/checkpoint-gate.sh ...`
  - `make checkpoint-cleanup CMD=...` → `./scripts/checkpoint-cleanup.sh ...`
  - `make checkpoint-init CMD=...` → `./scripts/checkpoint-init.sh ...`

  **New Wrapper Scripts Created**:
  - `scripts/status-checkpoint.sh` - Check checkpoint progress status
  - `scripts/update-checkpoint.sh` - Update checkpoint to specific step
  - `scripts/cleanup-checkpoint.sh` - Clean up checkpoint tracking
  - `scripts/init-checkpoint.sh` - Initialize checkpoint (already existed, now used consistently)

  **Commands Updated** (17 total):
  - create-plan, execute-plan, review-plan, new-learnings, create-command
  - review-changes, fix-errors-whitelisted, merge-settings
  - check-commands, check-logs, check-module-consistency
  - commit, compact-changes, compact-guidelines, compact-tasks
  - migrate-module-to-zig-abi, migrate-module-to-zig-struct

  **Changes**: 17 files updated with 366 insertions/deletions, all maintaining command-specific logic while using consistent checkpoint interface

  **Benefits**:
  - Centralized checkpoint management: Update behavior in wrapper scripts, affects all commands
  - Consistency: All 31 commands (12 simple + 19 complex) now use standardized checkpoint scripts
  - Maintainability: Wrapper scripts are the single source of truth for checkpoint operations
  - Clarity: Commands focus on their logic, not checkpoint implementation details
  - Scalability: Easy to add checkpoint features to wrapper scripts, benefit all commands

## 2025-10-18 (Session 2)

- **Simple Command Wrapper Script Pattern**

  Standardized 12 simple commands (≤15 steps) to use checkpoint wrapper scripts with single `./scripts/run-<cmd>.sh` entry points for cleaner, more discoverable execution.

  **Problem**: Simple commands had verbose checkpoint sections mixing direct make commands with script references, creating inconsistency with the check-docs.md pattern that cleanly separated concerns.

  **Solution**: Applied unified checkpoint wrapper pattern to all simple commands:
  - Single entry point: `./scripts/run-<cmd>.sh` orchestrates all stages
  - Standardized sections: "Checkpoint Wrapper Scripts" documents 4 core scripts
  - Cleaner documentation: Removed redundant checkpoint initialization code
  - Centralized management: All checkpoint logic in reusable wrappers

  **Changes**:
  - **13 command documentation files** updated: check-naming, next-priority, next-task, analyze-exec, analyze-tests, build, build-clean, run-exec, run-tests, sanitize-exec, sanitize-tests, tsan-exec, tsan-tests
  - **13 new wrapper scripts** created with standardized structure (3-stage execution)
  - All wrappers use init-checkpoint.sh, require-checkpoint.sh, gate-checkpoint.sh, complete-checkpoint.sh

  **Benefits**:
  - Consistency: All simple commands follow identical pattern
  - Simplicity: Users run single `./scripts/run-<cmd>.sh` instead of multiple commands
  - Discoverability: Wrapper script existence signals checkpoint support
  - Maintainability: Centralized checkpoint management
  - Clarity: Each stage clearly documented (build, execute, verify/analyze)

  **Scope**: Only applied to 12 simple commands; 19 complex commands (>15 steps) with custom logic retain their detailed documentation for specific methodologies.

## 2025-10-18

- **Checkpoint Wrapper Script Standardization**

  Migrated all 31 slash commands to use standardized checkpoint wrapper scripts, eliminating code duplication and ensuring consistent dash-based naming conventions.

  **Problem**: Commands used manual if/then/else patterns for checkpoint initialization (7-8 lines), precondition checks (5 lines), and direct make calls for gates. This created duplication, inconsistency, and maintenance overhead across 30+ command files.

  **Solution**: Replaced all manual patterns with wrapper script calls:
  - Initialization: `./scripts/checkpoint-init.sh <cmd> '<steps>'` (replaces 7-8 line if/then/else)
  - Preconditions: `./scripts/checkpoint-require.sh <cmd>` (replaces 5 line check)
  - Gates: `./scripts/checkpoint-gate.sh <cmd> "<gate>" "<steps>"` (replaces make call)
  - Completion: `./scripts/checkpoint-complete.sh <cmd>` (already standardized)

  **Changes**:
  - **60 gate commands** updated across 31 files (analyze-exec, analyze-tests, build, build-clean, check-commands, check-logs, check-module-consistency, check-naming, commit, compact-changes, compact-guidelines, compact-tasks, create-command, create-plan, execute-plan, fix-errors-whitelisted, merge-settings, migrate-module-to-zig-abi, migrate-module-to-zig-struct, new-learnings, next-priority, next-task, review-changes, review-plan, run-exec, run-tests, sanitize-exec, sanitize-tests, tsan-exec, tsan-tests, check-docs)
  - **30 initialization patterns** simplified from multi-line to single-line wrapper calls
  - **29 precondition patterns** simplified from 5 lines to 1 line
  - **1 template pattern** updated in create-command.md to use new gate syntax

  **Benefits**:
  - Reduced code duplication: Initialization from 7-8 lines → 1 line per command
  - Consistent naming: All wrapper scripts enforce dash-based temp file naming
  - Centralized maintenance: Update behavior in one place, affects all commands
  - Clearer documentation: Commands more concise and easier to understand
  - Alignment with temp file naming standards (commits e264d77, 4dd5056)

  **Impact**: All checkpoint operations now use standardized patterns defined in `/scripts/*-checkpoint.sh`, making it easier to maintain and update checkpoint behavior across the entire command suite.

- **Checkpoint Command Name Validation**

  Added validation to all checkpoint scripts to detect and warn about underscore usage in command names, preventing tracking file naming inconsistencies.

  **Problem**: Commands could be invoked with either dashes or underscores (e.g., `check-naming` vs `check_naming`), creating tracking files with inconsistent names (`/tmp/check-naming-progress.txt` vs `/tmp/check_naming-progress.txt`). This caused checkpoint-update and complete-checkpoint scripts to fail with "Tracking file not found" errors.

  **Solution**: Added validation block to all 5 checkpoint scripts that warns when command names contain underscores, pointing users to the dash-based naming standard.

  **Files Modified**:
  - `scripts/checkpoint-init.sh`: Added lines 19-27
  - `scripts/checkpoint-update.sh`: Added lines 14-20
  - `scripts/checkpoint-status.sh`: Added lines 13-19
  - `scripts/checkpoint-cleanup.sh`: Added lines 15-21
  - `scripts/checkpoint-gate.sh`: Added lines 13-19

  **Warning Message**: Clear guidance pointing to dash-based convention: "Based on temp file naming standardization, use dashes instead. Example: 'check-naming' not 'check_naming'"

  **Impact**: Prevents silent failures in checkpoint workflows by catching naming inconsistencies at the point of use, aligns with temporary file naming standardization (commits e264d77, 4dd5056).

- **Temporary File Naming Standardization**

  Standardized all temporary file naming across the project to use dash-based naming, matching bash script conventions and eliminating mixed naming patterns.

  **Motivation**: Project had inconsistent temp file naming - checkpoint files used underscores (`/tmp/check_naming_progress.txt`), while scripts used dashes (`checkpoint-init.sh`). This created cognitive overhead and violated principle of least surprise.

  **Implementation**: Four-commit sequence completing full standardization:
  1. **Checkpoint tracking files** (commit 4dd5056): Updated 50 files - 12 checkpoint scripts (checkpoint-init.sh, checkpoint-update.sh, checkpoint-status.sh, checkpoint-gate.sh, checkpoint-cleanup.sh, plus enhanced variants), 30 command files (.opencode/command/ar/*.md), 9 KB articles with checkpoint references. Changed pattern from `/tmp/${COMMAND}_progress.txt` to `/tmp/${COMMAND}-progress.txt`.
  2. **Other temp files** (commit e264d77): Updated 3 files - detect-circular-dependencies.sh (module_deps → module-deps), check_commands.py (structure_fix_report → structure-fix-report), fix_commands.py (structure_fix_report → structure-fix-report).
  3. **Documentation alignment** (commit 85612e8): Updated 29 files - 22 command files with checkpoint progress file references and example output (e.g., "Starting: analyze_exec" → "Starting: analyze-exec"), 7 KB articles with temp file examples (delegate_results → delegate-results, ci_log → ci-log, test_output → test-output, changed_files → changed-files, test_tracking → test-tracking, debug_test → debug-test).
  4. **Guidelines documentation** (commit 5ad576b): Added comprehensive temp file naming convention to AGENTS.md Section 8 with pattern definition (`/tmp/<command-name>-<purpose>.<ext>`), examples, and consistency notes.

  **Three-Tier Naming Convention**:
  - Bash scripts: `<action>-<object>.sh` (e.g., `checkpoint-init.sh`)
  - Python scripts: `<verb>_<noun>.py` (e.g., `check_commands.py`, PEP 8)
  - Temp files: `/tmp/<command-name>-<purpose>.<ext>` (e.g., `/tmp/check-logs-output.txt`)

  **Files Modified**: 83 files total across all four commits (12 scripts, 52 command files, 16 KB articles, 1 guideline document, 2 Python scripts)

  **Verification**: All checkpoint workflows tested and verified working correctly. Complete grep verification confirmed no remaining mixed naming patterns.

  **Impact**: Complete project-wide naming consistency eliminates cognitive overhead, new developers see unified patterns, documentation accurately reflects implementation, temp files immediately identifiable by naming pattern.

- **Check-Docs Workflow Script Extraction**

  Extracted checkpoint-based documentation validation and fix workflow from the check-docs command definition into a standalone, reusable script.

  **Implementation**: Created `scripts/run-check-docs.sh` containing all 5 checkpoint stages (Initial Check, Preview Fixes, Apply Fixes, Verify Resolution, Commit and Push) with proper gate checks and conditional flow logic. Simplified `.opencode/command/ar/check-docs.md` to delegate to the script instead of inline code.

  **Benefits**: Improves maintainability, makes the workflow repeatable and version-controllable, simplifies command definition, preserves all checkpoint tracking and gate validation behavior, follows project pattern of extracting complex logic into reusable scripts.

  **Files Modified**: `.opencode/command/ar/check-docs.md` (210 deletions of inline bash code), `scripts/run-check-docs.sh` (210 lines, new file).

  **Verification**: Bash syntax validated, script ready for execution.

- **Documentation Validation Error Fixes (Session 2025-10-18)**

  Fixed 12 documentation validation errors across 4 files identified by `make check-docs`.

  **Files Modified**:
  - `.opencode/command/ar/create-plan.md`: Fixed 7 errors (functions: ar_foo__{create,destroy,set_max_size,write}; type: ar_file_delegate_t)
  - `.opencode/command/ar/execute-plan.md`: Fixed 3 errors (function: ar_foo__create; type: ar_foo_t)
  - `.opencode/command/ar/review-plan.md`: Fixed 2 errors (function: ar_foo__create; type: ar_foo_t)
  - `kb/review-plan-command-improvements.md`: Fixed 1 error (function: ar_foo__create; type: ar_foo_t)

  **Resolution Method**: Applied `batch_fix_docs.py` with dry-run verification followed by manual fix for remaining ar_file_delegate_t reference. All non-existent function and type references marked with `// EXAMPLE: Hypothetical [function|type]` comments per validated-documentation-examples.md pattern.

  **Verification**: `make check-docs` now passes with 579 files checked, all references valid. Build includes documentation validation gate confirming no regressions.

  **Impact**: Documentation is now fully validated and clean. Supports high-quality documentation standards and prevents future reference errors through batch fix patterns.

- **Plan Command Improvements from Session 2025-10-18**

  Implemented comprehensive improvements to all three plan commands based on session learnings about checkpoint discipline, NULL parameter validation, and workflow consolidation.

  **Review-Plan Command Restructuring**: Consolidated checkpoint structure from 11 steps to 6 steps by merging per-iteration verification aspects (Steps 4-7: Iteration Structure, TDD Methodology, GREEN Minimalism, Memory Management) into single interactive Step 3 "Review Each Iteration" with mandatory one-at-a-time user acceptance loop. Added multi-line presentation format for findings, NULL parameter validation checklist, comprehensive per-iteration verification covering all 14 TDD lessons. Prevents checkpoint discipline violations where steps were batch-marked complete without reviewing all iterations.

  **Create-Plan Command Enhancement**: Added mandatory NULL parameter validation to Step 3 with systematic coverage check requiring one iteration per parameter, malloc failure iterations using dlsym technique, complete error handling for all public functions (create, destroy, setters, operations). Includes comprehensive examples showing correct vs incorrect coverage, allocation failure testing templates, and validation requirements before proceeding to Step 4.

  **Execute-Plan Command Enhancement**: Added three special case execution guidance sections to Step 8: iteration completion summary format (structured RED/GREEN/REFACTOR reporting), NULL parameter iteration execution pattern (minimal NULL checks without over-implementation), malloc failure iteration execution using dlsym technique (separate `_dlsym_tests.c` files, wrapper implementation, build integration notes). Ensures consistent execution of error handling iterations across all plans.

  **New KB Articles**:
  - [checkpoint-step-consolidation-pattern.md](kb/checkpoint-step-consolidation-pattern.md): Documents pattern for consolidating per-item verification steps into interactive loops, preventing checkpoint batching violations. Includes review-plan example (11→6 steps), consolidation decision criteria, implementation guidance.
  - [review-plan-command-improvements.md](kb/review-plan-command-improvements.md): Documents session 2025-10-18 learnings including what worked (interactive review, fixing during review, multi-line format), what didn't (checkpoint violations, missing proactive validation), 8 recommended improvements with implementation priority, example improved workflow.

  **KB Integration**: Updated KB index (kb/README.md) adding new articles to sections 1.1 (Workflow & Planning) and 1.4 (Knowledge Management). Added cross-references to 4 existing KB articles (checkpoint-implementation-guide.md, iterative-plan-review-protocol.md, tdd-plan-review-checklist.md, plan-review-status-tracking.md). Updated all three plan commands' "Related KB Articles" sections referencing new patterns.

  **Files Modified**: 3 command files (review-plan.md, create-plan.md, execute-plan.md), 2 new KB articles, KB index, 4 KB articles with cross-references

  **Impact**: Commands now enforce NULL parameter coverage proactively, prevent checkpoint discipline violations through consolidated interactive loops, provide consistent guidance for error handling execution. Session improvements captured as reusable patterns for future command development.

- **FileDelegate TDD Plan Review Complete**

  Completed comprehensive review of FileDelegate implementation plan (15 iterations across Cycles 8-12) following strict TDD methodology with all 14 lessons enforced.

  **Review Process**: Interactive iteration-by-iteration review with user acceptance, fixing issues immediately during review rather than deferring to later. Applied multi-line findings presentation format for better readability.

  **Fixes Applied**:
  - Fixed Lesson 11 violation in Iteration 8.1: Removed over-implementation (NULL checks and malloc failure handling implemented without tests). Updated GREEN phase to minimal implementation only.
  - Added 19 new iterations for comprehensive error handling coverage including NULL parameter validation (8.1.1-8.1.3, 8.2.1, 9.0.1-9.0.2, 9.2.1-9.2.2, 11.0.1-11.0.3, 11.2.1-11.2.3, 12.0.1-12.0.2, 12.3.1-12.3.3)
  - Split iterations with multiple assertions (Lesson 2 violations): 9.2 → 9.2.1/9.2.2, 11.2 → 11.2.1/11.2.2/11.2.3, 12.3 → 12.3.1/12.3.2/12.3.3
  - Added malloc failure testing iteration (8.1.3) using dlsym technique per [dlsym-test-interception-technique.md](kb/dlsym-test-interception-technique.md)
  - Enhanced Goal 1 temporary corruption documentation in multiple iterations showing full function context with TEMPORARY markers

  **NULL Parameter Coverage**: Added systematic NULL parameter handling iterations for all public functions following pattern: one iteration per parameter, one iteration for malloc failure. Functions covered: create() (log, path, malloc), destroy() (delegate), read() (delegate, path), write() (delegate, path, content), set_max_size() (delegate).

## 2025-10-18

- **TDD Cycle 7 - Message Delegation Routing COMPLETE**

  Completed final 3 iterations (2-4) of message routing via delegation following strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR TDD methodology with comprehensive test validation.

  **Iteration 2 - Verify Agent Routing**: Added VERIFICATION test `test_send_instruction_evaluator__routes_to_agent()` proving positive IDs still route to agents after delegation refactoring. RED phase proved test validity by temporarily routing positive IDs to delegation (wrong!) causing assertion failure. GREEN phase removed corruption restoring correct agency routing. REFACTOR phase determined no improvements needed.

  **Iteration 3 - Handle Non-Existent Delegate**: Added ERROR HANDLING test `test_send_instruction_evaluator__nonexistent_delegate_returns_false()` verifying graceful failure for unregistered delegates. RED phase proved test validity by temporarily returning true for non-existent delegates causing assertion failure. GREEN phase removed corruption restoring proper error handling (returns false and destroys message). REFACTOR phase determined error handling already clean.

  **Iteration 4 - Documentation**: Updated ar_send_instruction_evaluator.md with comprehensive "Error Handling" section including 5-row table documenting all error cases (non-existent agent/delegate, invalid expressions, agent_id=0 no-op) with behavior and message handling.

  **Files Modified**: modules/ar_send_instruction_evaluator_tests.c (+2 test functions, updated main()), modules/ar_send_instruction_evaluator.md (+Error Handling section), plans/message_routing_via_delegation_plan.md (status COMMITTED→IMPLEMENTED for iterations 2-4), TODO.md (marked Cycle 1 complete)

  **Temporary Corruption Pattern**: Both verification iterations applied temporary corruption in implementation to prove assertions catch real bugs (Lesson 7 compliance - RED phase Goal 1: prove test validity)

  **Quality Metrics**: Clean build (1m 34s), 10/10 send evaluator tests passing (79 total system tests), zero memory leaks (0 bytes), all sanitizers passed, make check-logs clean

  **TDD Methodology Compliance**: All 14 lessons verified including critical Lesson 7 (assertion validity via temporary corruption), both Goal 1 (prove validity) and Goal 2 (identify implementation) completed for each RED phase

  **Key Achievement**: TDD Cycle 7 COMPLETE - Full message routing infrastructure with comprehensive test coverage (agent routing verification + error handling validation) and complete documentation ready for built-in delegate implementation (Phase 2)

- **Helper Script Extraction & Refactoring**

  Extracted 20+ verification and analysis scripts from checkpoint commands to standalone helper scripts for improved maintainability and reusability.

  **Scripts Extracted**:
  - From execute-plan: plan sanity checking, iteration status/pending/counting scripts, discovery/verification/analysis patterns
  - From review-changes: 6 verification scripts for docs/changelog/whitelist/build
  - From check-logs: error categorization
  - From compact-guidelines: KB link validation
  - From new-learnings: comprehensive search, integration verification
  - From compact-changes: pattern analysis
  - From compact-tasks: verification logic
  - From check-module-consistency: discovery patterns
  - From migrate-module-to-zig-struct: dependency analysis
  - From fix-errors-whitelisted: whitelist analysis

  **KB Enhancement**: Added command-helper-script-extraction-pattern.md documenting extraction patterns

  **Impact**: Commands now delegate to focused helper scripts, enabling script reuse across commands and easier testing/maintenance

- **Command Creation Automation**

  Added create-command slash command for automated checkpoint command creation with 8-step workflow.

  **Workflow**: Skeleton generation, stage structure, checkpoint tracking, documentation, Makefile integration, .slashcommandrc updates, user summary, git staging

  **Implementation**: Comprehensive script generating command structure from templates, automatic documentation updates, checkpoint integration following established patterns

  **Impact**: Reduces command creation time from 30+ minutes to under 5 minutes with consistent structure and documentation

- **Execute-Plan Command Enhancement**

  Added auto-update and auto-commit functionality with git integration.

  **Features**:
  - Automatic plan status updates from COMMITTED to IMPLEMENTED
  - Automatic documentation updates (plan.md updates)
  - Automatic commit creation with standardized messages following established patterns

  **Verification**: Added COMMITTED iteration verification (Step 6) ensuring iterations match expected states before execution

  **Impact**: Eliminates manual plan updates and commit creation, ensures plan accuracy before execution

- **Documentation Path Standardization**

  Standardized all command location references to `.opencode/command/ar` canonical path across 21 files.

  **Updates**: AGENTS.md Project Structure section, 2 command files (check-commands.md, compact-guidelines.md), 12 KB articles with command path examples, 5 scripts (check_commands.py, check_kb_integration.py, fix_commands.py, remove_with_instance_suffix.py, update_checkpoints_in_newlearnings.sh), TODO.md command enhancement section

  **Rationale**: Ensures consistent references to actual command location rather than legacy symlink (.claude/commands), symlink remains for backward compatibility

  **Impact**: All documentation and scripts now consistently reference .opencode/command/ar as primary location with fallback support where needed

- **Create-Plan Validation Gates**

  Added three validation mechanisms to prevent checkpoint discipline violations in create-plan command.

  **Gate 1 - Plan Structure Validation**: validate_plan_structure.sh checks iteration count, required sections (Objective/RED/GREEN/Verification), GOAL 1/GOAL 2 markers after Step 6

  **Gate 2 - RED Corruption Evidence**: Requires /tmp/red-corruptions-evidence.txt documenting how each assertion will fail (Lesson 7 enforcement), validate_red_corruptions.sh verifies format for Step 7

  **Gate 3 - GREEN Minimalism Evidence** (optional): validate_green_minimalism.sh checks for hardcoded/minimal/forced-by-test keywords in Step 8

  **Benefits**: Can't skip Step 6 without actual iterations in file, can't skip Step 7 without documenting corruptions, evidence files create accountability trail, validation gates catch incomplete work

  **Impact**: Addresses checkpoint discipline violations where steps 6-13 were batch-updated without proper execution

- **FileDelegate TDD Plan Creation**

  Created comprehensive TDD plan for FileDelegate implementation covering Cycles 8-12 with 15 iterations.

  **Scope**:
  - Cycle 8: Basic structure (create/destroy/type)
  - Cycle 9: File read operations with ownership
  - Cycle 10: Path validation and security
  - Cycle 11: File write operations
  - Cycle 12: Size limits and configuration

  **Methodology**: All RED phases include temporary corruption per Lesson 7, proper GREEN minimalism, comprehensive verification steps

  **Status**: Plan created with PENDING REVIEW markers for iterations 1-15, requires thorough review before implementation

  **Note**: Plan creation violated checkpoint discipline (steps 6-13 batch-updated), prompting creation of validation gates above to prevent future violations

- **Pre-Commit Checklist Enhancement**

  Emphasized CHANGELOG.md as mandatory pre-commit requirement with explicit reminders.

  **Changes**:
  - Step 6 changed to "CRITICAL - NEVER FORGET" with emphasis on ALL commits
  - Split TODO.md into separate step 7
  - Updated "Remember" section with "CHANGELOG (NEVER SKIP)" in bold
  - Added new warning section "⚠️ CHANGELOG.md is MANDATORY" with verification command (`git log --oneline -5`)

  **Rationale**: Recent session showed CHANGELOG.md updates were sometimes forgotten after commits

  **Impact**: CHANGELOG.md requirement now highly visible in 3 places within Pre-Commit Checklist section, making it virtually impossible to overlook

- **CHANGELOG.md Format Improvement**

  Converted CHANGELOG entries from dense single-line format to readable multi-line format for better human readability.

  **Previous Format**: Single long lines with semicolon-separated sections (hard to scan and read)

  **New Format**:
  - Title on its own line
  - Brief overview paragraph
  - Labeled subsections with bold headers (Implementation, Features, Impact, etc.)
  - Bullet lists for multiple items
  - Blank lines between sections for visual separation

  **Impact**: CHANGELOG entries are now significantly easier to scan and read, especially for complex multi-part changes. Applied to all 2025-10-18 entries (7 entries reformatted).

- **Multi-Line CHANGELOG Format Standard**

  Established comprehensive multi-line format standard for CHANGELOG.md and updated all compaction guidance to maintain readability.

  **New KB Article** (kb/changelog-multi-line-format.md):
  - Defines multi-line format standard with required elements
  - Shows WRONG vs RIGHT examples (single-line vs multi-line)
  - Documents format: title, overview, labeled sections, blank lines
  - Provides compaction guidelines: reduce verbosity, not structure
  - Target: 30-50% reduction by trimming words, not removing structure

  **Updated Documentation**:
  - kb/documentation-compacting-pattern.md: Added multi-line format examples, 7-step compaction guide
  - compact-changes.md command: Added "CRITICAL" multi-line format section, updated all examples
  - AGENTS.md: Pre-commit checklist now references multi-line format standard

  **Deprecated Script**: scripts/compact_changelog.py marked as deprecated (creates unreadable single-line format), preserved for reference

  **Impact**: Future CHANGELOG compaction will maintain readability while achieving 30-50% space savings through verbosity reduction, not structure removal. Single-line format tools deprecated.

## 2025-10-17
- **Execute-Plan Command Quality Gates**: Added comprehensive quality gate system for TDD plan execution with 3-stage verification (Stage 1: Test verification after RED, Stage 2: Implementation verification after GREEN, Stage 3: Documentation verification after REFACTOR); **Gate Implementation**: Quality Gate 3 verifies ar_send_instruction_evaluator.md updated with error handling docs, gates enforce workflow discipline preventing progression without proper verification; **Checkpoint Tracking**: Added checkpoint tracking for all 12 intermediate steps within execute-plan workflow (Step 3 has 9 sub-steps for RED/GREEN/REFACTOR cycles), enabling resumable execution and progress tracking; **Step 3 Restructuring**: Restructured to prevent assumption-based errors with explicit iteration number verification, mandatory output reading before status updates, forced sequential execution; **Verification Enhancements**: Added git status verification to ensure clean working tree before commits, code verification requirement reading actual implementation before marking GREEN complete; **Impact**: Eliminates assumption-based errors, enforces proper TDD discipline, provides granular progress tracking
- **RED Phase Dual Goals Pattern**: Implemented and documented RED Phase Dual Goals Pattern enforcing both Goal 1 (prove test validity via temporary corruption) and Goal 2 (identify implementation needs) for every RED phase; **Implementation**: Updated execute-plan command Step 3 with explicit dual-goal verification, added mandatory corruption application to prove assertions catch real bugs (Lesson 7 compliance); **KB Enhancement**: Added red-phase-dual-goals-pattern.md to KB index and AGENTS.md with comprehensive examples from TDD Cycle 7 Iteration 2; **Impact**: Ensures every RED phase proves test validity through temporary corruption while also identifying implementation requirements, preventing invalid tests from passing to GREEN phase
- **Plan Management Tools**: Created 4 helper scripts for plan analysis and verification (count-plan-iterations.sh counts total iterations, list-iteration-status.sh shows status distribution, list-pending-iterations.sh identifies next work, plan-sanity-check.sh validates status consistency); **Integration**: Scripts integrated into execute-plan and new-learnings commands for automated plan validation; **Impact**: Automated plan status tracking and validation reducing manual verification effort

## 2025-10-16 (Session 2)
- **TDD Cycle 7 - Message Delegation Routing (Iteration 1) COMPLETE**: Successfully executed Iterations 1.1-1.2 implementing ID-based message routing from send evaluator to delegation system following strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR TDD methodology; **Iteration 1.1 - Send to Delegate Returns True**: Added test verifying negative ID routing succeeds, hardcoded return true in GREEN phase (minimalism), added AR_ASSERT header, test confirmed assertion catches real failures (RED phase failed as expected when routing to non-existent agent); **Iteration 1.2 - Delegate Receives Message**: Added new assertion forcing real delegation routing (Iteration 1.1's hardcoded return wouldn't pass), replaced with `ar_delegation__send_to_delegate()` call in GREEN phase, second RED phase passed confirming forced progression; **Implementation**: Modified ar_send_instruction_evaluator.zig with three-branch routing (agent_id == 0: no-op, agent_id > 0: agency, agent_id < 0: delegation), test function `test_send_instruction_evaluator__routes_to_delegate()` covers both assertions; **Quality Metrics**: Build (1m 34s), 79 total tests passing, zero memory leaks verified, all sanitizers passed, make check-logs clean; **Files Modified**: modules/ar_send_instruction_evaluator.zig (12 lines routing logic), modules/ar_send_instruction_evaluator_tests.c (added AR_ASSERT header, added new test function with 2 assertions, updated main()); **Files Updated**: plans/message_routing_via_delegation_plan.md (status REVIEWED → IMPLEMENTED for iterations 1.1-1.2); **Key Achievement**: Core message routing to delegation infrastructure established with proper TDD progression forcing real implementation; **Next Phase**: Iterations 1.3.1-1.3.3 will add property validation tests (message content/type preservation) with temporary corruption pattern, Iteration 2-4 for agent routing verification and error handling
