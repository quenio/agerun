## Command
```bash
make clean build 2>&1 && make check-logs
```

## Expected Output

### Success State
```
Removing build artifacts...
Cleaning logs directory...
Building library...
Running all tests...

### Failure States

**Clean Failure (rare):**
```
Removing build artifacts...
rm: cannot remove 'bin/': Permission denied
make: *** [clean] Error 1
```

**Build Failure After Clean:**
```
Removing build artifacts...
Cleaning logs directory...

## Key Points

- **Clean build takes longer** (~1m 24s vs ~20s incremental)
- **Removes all artifacts** including bin/, logs/, and object files
- **Required for**: Major refactoring, dependency changes, CI verification
- **Always use `2>&1`** to capture stderr for complete error visibility
- **Always follow with `make check-logs`** to verify CI readiness
