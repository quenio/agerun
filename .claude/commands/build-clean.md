Execute a clean build for comprehensive build verification with minimal output and check for hidden issues.


# Clean Build
## Checkpoint Tracking

This command uses checkpoint tracking to ensure systematic execution and verification.

### Initialize Tracking
```bash
# Start the build clean process
make checkpoint-init CMD=build_clean STEPS='"Prepare" "Execute" "Verify"'
```

**Expected output:**
```
📍 Starting: build_clean (3 steps)
📁 Tracking: /tmp/build_clean_progress.txt
→ Run: make checkpoint-update CMD=build_clean STEP=1
```

### Check Progress
```bash
make checkpoint-status CMD=build_clean
```

**Expected output (example at 33% completion):**
```
📈 command: X/Y steps (Z%)
   [████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] Z%
→ Next: make checkpoint-update CMD=command STEP=N
```

## Minimum Requirements

**MANDATORY for successful completion:**
- [ ] Command executes without errors
- [ ] Expected output is produced
- [ ] No unexpected warnings or issues




**MANDATORY**: Always run check-logs after clean build. CI will reject builds that fail log checks.

**IMPORTANT**: Clean builds are required when:
- Changing dependencies
- Major refactoring
- Suspicious incremental build behavior
- Before final commit

**Critical questions**:
- Did the previous incremental build behave unexpectedly?
- Have you changed any header files?
- Are you seeing strange linker errors?

For example, if you see "undefined reference" errors in incremental builds, a clean build often resolves them.

#### [EXECUTION GATE]
```bash
# Verify ready to execute
make checkpoint-gate CMD=build_clean GATE="Ready" REQUIRED="1"
```

**Expected gate output:**
```
✅ GATE 'Gate Name' - PASSED
   Verified: Steps 1,2,3
```

## Command

#### [CHECKPOINT START - EXECUTION]

```bash
make clean build 2>&1 && make check-logs

# Mark execution complete
make checkpoint-update CMD=build_clean STEP=2
```


#### [CHECKPOINT END - EXECUTION]
## Expected Output

### Success State
```
Removing build artifacts...
Cleaning logs directory...
Building library...
Running all tests...
All 68 tests passed! (1126 assertions)
Build took 1m 24s
========================================
         BUILD SUCCESSFUL! ✓
========================================
Running log checks...
✅ No errors found in logs - CI ready!
```

### Failure States

**Clean Failure (rare):**
```
Removing build artifacts...
rm: cannot remove 'bin/': Permission denied
make: *** [clean] Error 1
```

**Build Failure After Clean:**
```
Removing build artifacts...
Cleaning logs directory...
Building library...
modules/ar_data.c:123: error: 'ar_data_t' undeclared
make: *** [build] Error 1
```


#### [CHECKPOINT COMPLETE]
```bash
# Show final summary
make checkpoint-status CMD=build_clean
```

**Expected completion output:**
```
========================================
   CHECKPOINT STATUS: build_clean
========================================

Progress: 3/3 steps (100%)

[████████████████████] 100%

✅ ALL CHECKPOINTS COMPLETE!

Summary:
  Preparation: ✓ Complete
  Execution: ✓ Complete  
  Verification: ✓ Complete

The build clean completed successfully!
```

```bash
# Clean up tracking
make checkpoint-cleanup CMD=build_clean
```

## Key Points

- **Clean build takes longer** (~1m 24s vs ~20s incremental)
- **Removes all artifacts** including bin/, logs/, and object files
- **Required for**: Major refactoring, dependency changes, CI verification
- **Always use `2>&1`** to capture stderr for complete error visibility
- **Always follow with `make check-logs`** to verify CI readiness
