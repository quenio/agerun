Execute comprehensive build verification with minimal output and check for hidden issues.

**Note**: The build runs all checks in parallel for efficiency ([details](../../../kb/parallel-build-job-integration.md)). Always use `make build` rather than running scripts directly ([details](../../../kb/make-target-testing-discipline.md)). All command documentation must achieve 90%+ scores or the build fails ([details](../../../kb/command-documentation-excellence-gate.md)).

# Build
## Checkpoint Tracking

This command uses checkpoint tracking to ensure systematic execution and verification.

### Initialize Tracking
```bash
# Start the build process
make checkpoint-init CMD=build STEPS='"Prepare" "Execute" "Verify"'
```

**Expected output:**
```
📍 Starting: build (3 steps)
📁 Tracking: /tmp/build_progress.txt
→ Run: make checkpoint-update CMD=build STEP=1
```

### Check Progress
```bash
make checkpoint-status CMD=build
```

**Expected output (example at 33% completion):**
```
📈 command: X/Y steps (Z%)
   [████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] Z%
→ Next: make checkpoint-update CMD=command STEP=N
```

## Minimum Requirements

**MANDATORY for successful completion:**
- [ ] Command executes without errors
- [ ] Expected output is produced
- [ ] No unexpected warnings or issues



#### [EXECUTION GATE]
```bash
# Verify ready to execute
make checkpoint-gate CMD=build GATE="Ready" REQUIRED="1"
```

**Expected gate output:**
```
✅ GATE 'Ready' - PASSED
   Verified: Steps 1
```

## Command

#### [CHECKPOINT START - EXECUTION]

```bash
make build 2>&1 && make check-logs

# Mark execution complete
make checkpoint-update CMD=build STEP=2
```

**Note**: If build fails due to CI network timeouts, see ([details](../../../kb/ci-network-timeout-diagnosis.md))
**Important**: `check-logs` analyzes logs generated by `build` - they must run in sequence ([details](../../../kb/build-logs-relationship-principle.md))


#### [CHECKPOINT END - EXECUTION]
## Expected Output

### Success State
```
Building library...
Running all tests...
All 68 tests passed! (1126 assertions)
Build took 1m 24s
========================================
         BUILD SUCCESSFUL! ✓
========================================
Running log checks...
✅ No errors found in logs - CI ready!
```

### Failure States

**Compilation Error:**
```
Building library...
modules/ar_data.c:123: error: expected ';' before '}' token
make: *** [build] Error 1
```

**Test Failure:**
```
Building library...
Running all tests...
FAILED: ar_string_tests
  Expected: "hello"
  Actual: "world"
67 of 68 tests passed
make: *** [build] Error 1
```

**Log Check Failure:**
```
Building library...
Running all tests...
All 68 tests passed!
Build took 1m 24s
========================================
         BUILD SUCCESSFUL! ✓
========================================
Running log checks...
❌ Found 3 errors in logs:
  - ERROR: Method evaluation failed (in test: ar_method_evaluator_tests)
  - ERROR: Assertion failed at line 45
  - ERROR: Memory leak detected
Fix these issues before pushing to CI.
```


#### [CHECKPOINT COMPLETE]
```bash
# Show final summary
make checkpoint-status CMD=build
```

**Expected completion output:**
```
========================================
   CHECKPOINT STATUS: build
========================================

Progress: 3/3 steps (100%)

[████████████████████] 100%

✅ ALL CHECKPOINTS COMPLETE!

Summary:
  Prepare: ✓ Complete
  Execute: ✓ Complete  
  Verify: ✓ Complete

The build completed successfully!
```

```bash
# Clean up tracking
make checkpoint-cleanup CMD=build
```

## Key Points

- **Always use `2>&1`** to capture stderr for complete error visibility
- **Always follow with `make check-logs`** to catch hidden issues
- Logs are only updated during build, not by check-logs ([details](../../../kb/build-logs-relationship-principle.md))
- The build must pass check-logs or CI will fail ([details](../../../kb/ci-check-logs-requirement.md))
- Check-logs includes deep analysis that can flag test output ([details](../../../kb/check-logs-deep-analysis-pattern.md))
- Build time varies: ~20s for incremental, ~1m 24s for full build
- Use compiler errors to guide refactoring ([details](../../../kb/compilation-driven-refactoring-pattern.md)) 

The Makefile uses generic parameterized targets to avoid duplication ([details](../../../kb/generic-make-targets-pattern.md)). Commands should document expected outputs for clarity ([details](../../../kb/command-output-documentation-pattern.md)) and follow the concise output principle ([details](../../../kb/concise-script-output-principle.md)).

**Important**: The build system runs parallel tests with different compilers (gcc for regular tests, clang for Thread Sanitizer). Each uses isolated build directories to prevent conflicts ([details](../../../kb/compiler-output-conflict-pattern.md)).

**Exit Code Handling**: When using popen() to run processes, remember that exit codes are multiplied by 256 ([details](../../../kb/exit-code-propagation-popen.md)). Non-critical operations should follow graceful degradation patterns ([details](../../../kb/graceful-degradation-pattern.md)).
