**Role: Project Manager**

Read CLAUDE.md in order to prepare yourself for this new session. Then, suggest the next priority based on the TODO.md file. 

When determining priority, use quantitative metrics where available ([details](../../kb/quantitative-priority-setting.md)):
- Error rates (e.g., "97.6% silent failures")
- Code duplication metrics
- Performance impacts
- Time/cost savings potential

Explain why you made that priority choice using specific data. Wait for my verification and suggestions. 

If I approved your choice, define a plan in the todos list in order to execute it. Estimate effort in TDD cycles ([details](../../kb/tdd-cycle-effort-estimation.md)). Wait for my approval of the plan, or for my adjustment to the plan.
