**Role: QA Engineer**

Build and run the agerun executable.

```bash
make run-exec 2>&1
```

Note: Using `2>&1` to capture stderr ensures memory leak warnings and error messages are visible.

**Methodology Persistence**: After processing messages, the executable saves all loaded methods to `agerun.methodology` file. Save failures are handled gracefully with warnings but don't prevent successful execution ([details](../../kb/graceful-degradation-pattern.md)).
