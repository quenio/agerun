Compact the CHANGELOG.md file by condensing completed milestones while preserving key information.
Follow these steps:
1. Read the CHANGELOG.md file and measure initial metrics (line count)
2. For each date section, identify completed milestones
3. For each completed milestone section:
   - Keep the main heading with completion status
   - Merge key bullet points into a concise summary
   - Preserve important metrics (file counts, occurrences, performance gains)
   - Remove detailed sub-bullets but keep critical achievements
   - Combine benefits into single line if multiple exist
4. Preserve:
   - All date headers
   - Overall document structure
   - Key metrics and numbers ([details](../../kb/quantitative-documentation-metrics.md))
   - Technology transitions mentioned
5. Add self-documenting entry to CHANGELOG for the compaction ([details](../../kb/self-documenting-modifications-pattern.md))
6. Write the compacted version back to CHANGELOG.md
7. Show quantitative summary: "Reduced from X to Y lines (Z% reduction)"
8. Update TODO.md with completed task ([details](../../kb/retroactive-task-documentation.md))
9. Commit and push the changes:
   - `git add CHANGELOG.md TODO.md`
   - `git commit -m "docs: compact CHANGELOG.md for improved readability

- Reduced CHANGELOG.md from X to Y lines (Z% reduction)
- Preserved all key metrics, dates, and technology transitions
- Combined related bullet points with semicolons for better conciseness
- Updated TODO.md to mark task as completed
- Added CHANGELOG.md entry for its own compaction

Impact: Makes changelog more scannable while maintaining complete historical
record of all milestones and achievements.

Guidelines for compaction:
- Keep one summary line per major achievement
- Preserve specific numbers (e.g., "968 occurrences", "103 files")
- Merge related items with semicolons
- Keep technology details (e.g., "Zig", "C compatibility")
- Remove redundant checkmarks within sections
- Maintain chronological order
- Keep section titles intact with âœ… markers
