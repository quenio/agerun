Compact the CHANGELOG.md file by condensing completed milestones while preserving key information.

Follow these steps:
1. Read the CHANGELOG.md file
2. For each date section, identify completed milestones
3. For each completed milestone section:
   - Keep the main heading with completion status
   - Merge key bullet points into a concise summary
   - Preserve important metrics (file counts, occurrences, performance gains)
   - Remove detailed sub-bullets but keep critical achievements
   - Combine benefits into single line if multiple exist
4. Preserve:
   - All date headers
   - Overall document structure
   - Key metrics and numbers
   - Technology transitions mentioned
5. Write the compacted version back to CHANGELOG.md
6. Show a summary of changes (lines before/after, sections processed)
7. Commit and push the changes:
   - `git add CHANGELOG.md`
   - `git commit -m "docs: compact CHANGELOG.md to streamline completed milestones"`
   - `git push`

Guidelines for compaction:
- Keep one summary line per major achievement
- Preserve specific numbers (e.g., "968 occurrences", "103 files")
- Merge related items with semicolons
- Keep technology details (e.g., "Zig", "C compatibility")
- Remove redundant checkmarks within sections
- Maintain chronological order
- Keep section titles intact with âœ… markers
