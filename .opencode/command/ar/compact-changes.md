Compact the CHANGELOG.md file by condensing completed milestones while preserving key information.

## CHECKPOINT WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT

**CRITICAL**: This command MUST use checkpoint tracking for ALL execution.

### In-Progress Workflow Detection

If a `/compact-changes` workflow is already in progress:

```bash
./scripts/status-checkpoint.sh compact-changes VERBOSE=--verbose
# Resume: ./scripts/update-checkpoint.sh compact-changes STEP=N
# Or reset: ./scripts/cleanup-checkpoint.sh compact-changes && ./scripts/init-checkpoint.sh compact-changes STEPS='"Measure Baseline" "Analyze Patterns" "Manual Compaction" "Verify Preservation" "Add Self-Entry" "Update TODO" "Commit Changes"'
```

### First-Time Initialization Check

```bash
./scripts/init-checkpoint.sh compact-changes '"Measure Baseline" "Analyze Patterns" "Manual Compaction" "Verify Preservation" "Add Self-Entry" "Update TODO" "Commit Changes"'
```

## PRECONDITION: Checkpoint Tracking Must Be Initialized

```bash
./scripts/require-checkpoint.sh compact-changes
```

## CRITICAL: Manual Compaction Strategy

**Key Learning from Session 2025-10-08**: Achieving 40-50%+ reduction in historical records requires **manual semantic analysis**, not automated scripts.

**Automation Limitations**:
- Scripts excel at mechanical tasks: combining bullets with semicolons, removing blank lines
- Scripts achieve ~10-20% reduction through these mechanical operations
- Scripts **CANNOT** perform semantic analysis needed for 40-50% reduction
- Scripts cannot identify related entries across different dates and rewrite them into coherent summaries

**Manual Compaction Approach** (for 40-50%+ reduction):
1. **Analyze entry relationships**: Identify patterns of repetitive work across multiple date sections
2. **Combine related entries**: Group entries describing the same work (e.g., "System Module Analysis" across 2025-08-23 to 2025-03-01)
3. **Rewrite redundant information**: Create coherent summaries instead of repetitive bullets
4. **Group date ranges**: Combine related work into range entries (e.g., "2025-09-27 to 2025-09-13" for Global API Removal)
5. **Preserve all critical information**: Maintain all metrics, dates, and key transitions

**When to Use Scripts vs. Manual**:
- **Scripts**: For mechanical cleanup achieving 10-20% reduction (initial pass)
- **Manual**: For significant reduction (40-50%+) requiring human judgment and semantic understanding
- **Best Practice**: Start with script for mechanical cleanup, then manual rewriting for deeper reduction

## CRITICAL - Multi-Line Format Requirement

**AS OF 2025-10-18**: CHANGELOG.md uses multi-line format for human readability.

**DO NOT** use scripts/compact_changelog.py (deprecated - creates unreadable single-line format)

**Compaction Strategy**:
- Reduce verbosity WITHIN sections, not by combining sections
- Maintain visual hierarchy (title, blank lines, labeled subsections)
- Target: 30-50% reduction by trimming words, NOT removing structure

See: `kb/changelog-multi-line-format.md` for complete format specification

## MANDATORY KB Consultation

Before compacting, you MUST:
1. Search: `grep "compact\|documentation\|changelog\|automation.*limitation\|manual.*semantic" kb/README.md`
2. Read these KB articles IN FULL using the read tool:
   - `kb/changelog-multi-line-format.md` - **CRITICAL**: Multi-line format standard (added 2025-10-18)
   - `kb/documentation-compacting-pattern.md` - **UPDATED**: automation vs. manual guidance with multi-line examples
   - `kb/selective-compaction-pattern.md` - for selection criteria
   - `kb/quantitative-documentation-metrics.md` - for metric preservation
   - `kb/kb-target-compliance-enforcement.md` - **MANDATORY**: How to enforce KB targets
3. **Check Related Patterns sections** in each article above and read any additional relevant articles found there
4. In your response, quote the multi-line format requirements
5. For 30-50% reduction: **Use manual compaction** with semantic analysis while maintaining multi-line format
6. **ENFORCE targets with gates**: Verify 30% minimum achieved

**Example of proper approach:**
```
The CHANGELOG.md has 533 lines with 200+ repetitive "System Module Analysis" entries 
spanning 2025-08-23 to 2025-03-01. This requires manual semantic analysis to:
1. Identify the related entries across different dates
2. Combine them into a coherent summary
3. Preserve all metrics while eliminating verbose repetition

Automated scripts cannot perform this semantic grouping and rewriting.
```

# Compact Changelog - Manual Semantic Analysis

## Checkpoint Tracking

This command uses checkpoint tracking to ensure systematic CHANGELOG.md compaction through manual semantic analysis. The process has 7 checkpoints across 3 phases with verification gates.

### Initialize Tracking
```bash
# Start the changelog compaction process
./scripts/init-checkpoint.sh compact-changes STEPS='"Measure Baseline" "Analyze Patterns" "Manual Compaction" "Verify Preservation" "Add Self-Entry" "Update TODO" "Commit Changes"'
```

**Expected output:**
```
üìç Starting: compact-changes (7 steps)
üìÅ Tracking: /tmp/compact-changes-progress.txt
‚Üí Run: ./scripts/update-checkpoint.sh compact-changes STEP=1
```

### Check Progress
```bash
./scripts/status-checkpoint.sh compact-changes
```

**Expected output (example at 43% completion):**
```
üìà compact-changes: 3/7 steps (43%)
   [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë] 43%
‚Üí Next: ./scripts/update-checkpoint.sh compact-changes STEP=4
```

## Minimum Requirements

**MANDATORY for successful compaction (per KB documentation-compacting-pattern):**
- [ ] **40-50%+ file size reduction achieved** (requires manual semantic analysis)
- [ ] All 157+ metrics and numbers preserved (verify with grep)
- [ ] All dates maintained
- [ ] Chronological order preserved
- [ ] Self-documenting entry added
- [ ] TODO.md updated with completion metrics
- [ ] Changes committed

**CRITICAL**: Achieving 40-50% reduction requires manual semantic analysis to identify and combine related entries across different dates. Automated scripts cannot perform this level of semantic understanding.

### Stage 1: Analysis (Steps 1-2)

#### [CHECKPOINT START - STAGE 1]

#### Steps 1-2: Analyze CHANGELOG

Run pattern analysis using helper script:

```bash
# Analyze CHANGELOG and save stats (Steps 1-2 combined)
./scripts/analyze-changelog-patterns.sh CHANGELOG.md | tee /tmp/compact-changes-stats.txt

# Mark both analysis steps complete
./scripts/update-checkpoint.sh compact-changes STEP=1
./scripts/update-checkpoint.sh compact-changes STEP=2
```

The script provides:
1. **Baseline Measurements** - Lines, bytes, metrics count
2. **Structural Analysis** - Date sections count
3. **Repetitive Pattern Detection** - Common topics appearing frequently
4. **Compaction Opportunities** - Analysis questions and recommendations

**Expected output:**
```
Analyzing CHANGELOG for patterns...
Date sections: 45
Repetitive patterns found:
- System Module: 28 occurrences
- Parser: 15 occurrences
- Global API: 12 occurrences

Analysis questions to consider:
[...]
‚úì Updated checkpoint 2/7 for compact-changes
```

#### [ANALYSIS GATE]
```bash
# Verify analysis before proceeding to manual work
./scripts/gate-checkpoint.sh compact-changes "Analysis Complete" "1,2"
```

**Expected gate output:**
```
‚úÖ GATE 'Analysis Complete' - PASSED
   Verified: Steps 1,2
```

#### [CHECKPOINT END]

### Stage 2: Manual Compaction (Steps 3-5)

#### [CHECKPOINT START - STAGE 2]

#### Step 3: Manual Semantic Compaction

**MANUAL WORK REQUIRED**: Edit CHANGELOG.md using your text editor. Apply these strategies:

**CRITICAL - Multi-line Format**: ALWAYS maintain multi-line format for readability. Do NOT compress to single lines with semicolons.

**Combining Repetitive Entries** (multi-line format):
```markdown
# Before (200+ verbose entries across dates):
## 2025-08-23
- System module analysis revealed X with detailed explanation...
## 2025-08-15
- Continued system module analysis for Y with more details...
## 2025-08-10
- Further system module analysis showed Z with lengthy description...

# After (single coherent entry - MULTI-LINE FORMAT):
## 2025-08-23 to 2025-03-01

- **System Module Architecture Analysis**

  Comprehensive analysis across 200+ entries revealing architectural patterns,
  critical issues, and improvement opportunities.

  **KB Enhancement**: Added 12+ new articles covering system design patterns,
  error propagation, and development practices

  **Impact**: Established clear architectural foundation with quantified
  improvement roadmap
```

**Reducing Verbosity Within Entries** (keep multi-line structure):
```markdown
# Before (verbose but already multi-line - 18 lines):
- **Feature Implementation**

  This feature was implemented by creating three new modules and updating
  five existing modules. The implementation involved adding comprehensive
  error handling throughout the system. Detailed testing was performed to
  ensure all edge cases were covered.

  **Implementation Details**: Modified ar_system.c (45 lines), ar_agency.h
  (12 lines), ar_interpreter.c (78 lines), and many other files with various
  changes throughout the codebase.

  **Quality Assurance**: Ran full test suite which showed 78 tests passing
  with zero memory leaks detected and all sanitizers passing cleanly.

# After (concise but still multi-line - 10 lines):
- **Feature Implementation**

  Created 3 new modules, updated 5 existing modules with comprehensive
  error handling and edge case coverage.

  **Implementation**: Core modules modified (ar_system.c, ar_agency.h,
  ar_interpreter.c), added error handling, updated 12 tests

  **Quality**: 78 tests passing, zero leaks, all sanitizers passed
```

**Grouping Date Ranges**:
```markdown
# Before (separate dates):
## 2025-09-27
- Removed "_with_instance" suffix (Stage 1)
## 2025-09-14
- Removed global functions (Stage 2)  
## 2025-09-13
- Completed global API removal

# After (grouped range):
## 2025-09-27 to 2025-09-13
- **Global API Removal & Documentation Enhancement**: Removed "_with_instance" suffix from 30 functions across ar_agency, ar_system, ar_methodology; **Systematic Updates**: Updated 132+ files with new API names; **Impact**: Clean architecture foundation with definitive API design
```

**Rewriting Verbose Bullets**:
- Combine related bullet points with semicolons
- Extract implementation details, preserve outcomes
- Keep all metrics inline (e.g., "132 files", "30 functions")
- Use bold section headers to organize information
- Maintain chronological integrity within grouped ranges

```bash
# After completing manual edits
echo "‚úÖ Manual semantic compaction complete"
echo "Review changes with: git diff CHANGELOG.md"
./scripts/update-checkpoint.sh compact-changes STEP=3
```

#### Step 4: Verify Preservation

```bash
# Verify all critical information preserved
./scripts/verify-changelog-preservation.sh /tmp/compact-changes-stats.txt

./scripts/update-checkpoint.sh compact-changes STEP=4
```

**Expected output:**
```
Verifying preservation...
New: 129 lines, 17131 bytes
Metrics found: 157 (expected: 157)
Line reduction: 75%
File size reduction: 86%
‚úÖ All metrics preserved
Date sections remaining: 16
‚úì Updated checkpoint 4/7 for compact-changes
```

#### Step 5: Add Self-Entry

```bash
# Add self-documenting entry to CHANGELOG
echo "Adding self-documenting entry..."
source /tmp/compact-changes-stats.txt

SESSION_NUM=$(grep "CHANGELOG.md.*Compaction" CHANGELOG.md | wc -l)
SESSION_NUM=$((SESSION_NUM + 1))

echo ""

read -p "Press Enter after adding the entry..."

./scripts/update-checkpoint.sh compact-changes STEP=5
```

#### [COMPACTION QUALITY GATE]
```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Verify sufficient reduction and metric preservation
source /tmp/compact-changes-stats.txt

# Enforce minimum reduction target using quality gate helper
if ! ./scripts/enforce-quality-gate.sh "File Size Reduction" "$SIZE_REDUCTION" "40" "ge" "Per documentation-compacting-pattern.md, CHANGELOG.md requires 40-50% reduction"; then
  echo "Current compaction is INCOMPLETE - continue until 40% is reached"
  exit 1
fi

if [ "$METRICS_OK" != "PASS" ]; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Some metrics may not be preserved"
  echo "Review: grep -oE '[0-9]+[%]|[0-9]+ (files|lines)' CHANGELOG.md"
fi

./scripts/gate-checkpoint.sh compact-changes "Compaction Quality" "3,4,5"
```

**Expected gate output:**
```
‚úÖ Compaction quality verified
‚úÖ GATE 'Compaction Quality' - PASSED
   Verified: Steps 3,4,5
```

#### [CHECKPOINT END]

### Stage 3: Documentation and Commit (Steps 6-7)

#### [CHECKPOINT START - STAGE 3]

#### Step 6: Update TODO

```bash
# Update TODO.md with completion
echo "Updating TODO.md..."
source /tmp/compact-changes-stats.txt

SESSION_NUM=$(grep "Session.*Manual semantic compaction" TODO.md | wc -l)
SESSION_NUM=$((SESSION_NUM + 1))

echo ""
echo "Add this to TODO.md under 'CHANGELOG.md Full Compaction' section:"
echo ""
echo "  - [x] Session $SESSION_NUM: Manual semantic compaction from $ORIGINAL_LINES to $NEW_LINES lines (${LINE_REDUCTION}% line reduction, ${SIZE_REDUCTION}% file size reduction); combined XXX+ repetitive entries into coherent summaries; exceeded KB target (40-50%) with human semantic analysis; preserved all ${METRICS_COUNT}+ metrics, dates, and milestones (Completed $(date +%Y-%m-%d))"
echo ""

read -p "Press Enter after updating TODO.md..."

./scripts/update-checkpoint.sh compact-changes STEP=6
```

#### Step 7: Commit Changes

```bash
# Commit documentation updates
echo "Committing changes..."
source /tmp/compact-changes-stats.txt

SESSION_NUM=$(grep "CHANGELOG.md.*Compaction" CHANGELOG.md | wc -l)

git add CHANGELOG.md TODO.md
git commit -m "Document CHANGELOG.md Session $SESSION_NUM manual compaction completion

#### [CHECKPOINT END]

## Why Manual Compaction?

**Automation cannot**:
- Identify that "System Module Analysis" entries from different dates are related
- Determine which entries can be semantically combined
- Rewrite verbose repetition into coherent summaries
- Understand context to group work by theme across time periods

**Manual semantic analysis can**:
- See patterns humans recognize (same work described differently)
- Apply judgment about what constitutes "related work"  
- Rewrite for clarity while preserving all information
- Achieve 40-50%+ reduction through intelligent synthesis

## Key Compaction Techniques

**Semantic Grouping**:
- Identify patterns across multiple date sections
- Group by theme (e.g., "Parser Error Logging", "Global API Removal")
- Use date ranges to show continuity of work

**Information Density**:
- Use bold section headers: `**Category**: Details`
- Combine related items with semicolons
- Extract implementation details, preserve outcomes and metrics
- Use succinct phrasing without losing precision

**Preservation Strategy**:
- ALL metrics must remain (numbers, percentages, counts)
- ALL dates must remain (either as headers or ranges)
- Technology names and key decisions must remain
- Chronological order must remain intact
