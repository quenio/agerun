Run static analysis on the executable code.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Let the script manage tracking

**DO NOT manually initialize before running this command.** The script handles all tracking initialization, execution, and cleanup automatically. Just run the script and let it complete.

## Quick Start

```bash
./scripts/run-analyze-exec.sh
```

That's it! The script will handle everything automatically.

## STEP VERIFICATION ENFORCEMENT

**MANDATORY**: After completing each step, you MUST verify step completion using the **step-verifier sub-agent** before proceeding to the next step ([details](../../../kb/sub-agent-verification-pattern.md)).

### About the step-verifier Sub-Agent

The **step-verifier** is a specialized sub-agent that independently verifies step completion:

- **Reads command files** to understand step requirements
- **Checks files, git status/diff, test results, build outputs** to verify accomplishments
- **Compares accomplishments against requirements** systematically
- **Reports verification results with evidence** (what was verified, what's missing)
- **Provides STOP instructions** when failures are detected (blocks execution until fixed)
- **Read-only agent**: Never modifies files, commits changes, or makes autonomous decisions

**CRITICAL**: The step-verifier independently verifies your claims. You report accomplishments with evidence; the step-verifier verifies by reading files and checking outputs.

### Step Verification Process

After completing each step, you MUST:

1. **Report accomplishments with concrete evidence**
   - Describe what was accomplished (files created/modified, commands executed, outputs produced)
   - Provide **concrete evidence**: actual file paths with line numbers, full command outputs, git diff output, test results with specific test names, grep/search output proving claims
   - **DO NOT** tell step-verifier what to verify - report what was done with evidence
   - **DO NOT** use vague summaries - provide specific details (see [kb/sub-agent-verification-pattern.md](../../../kb/sub-agent-verification-pattern.md) for examples)

2. **Invoke step-verifier sub-agent**
   - Use `mcp_sub-agents_run_agent` tool with:
     - Agent: `"step-verifier"`
     - Prompt: See format below
     - The step-verifier will independently verify your claims

3. **Handle Verification Results**
  
   **If verification PASSES** (report shows "✅ STEP VERIFIED" or "All requirements met"):
     - Proceed to next step
     -   
   **If verification FAILS** (report shows "⚠️ STOP EXECUTION" or missing elements):
     - **STOP execution immediately** - do not proceed to next step
     - Fix all reported issues from verification report
     - Re-invoke step-verifier with updated evidence after fixes
     - Only proceed after verification report shows "✅ STEP VERIFIED"
  
   **If sub-agent CANNOT be executed** (MCP unavailable or tool error):
     - STOP execution immediately
     - Inform user: "⚠️ Step verification sub-agent unavailable. Please manually verify Step N completion before proceeding."
     - Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding

### How to Invoke step-verifier

Use the `mcp_sub-agents_run_agent` tool:

```
Agent: "step-verifier"
Prompt: "Verify Step N: [Step Title] completion for analyze-exec command.

Todo Item: [Description of what the step accomplished]
Command File: .opencode/command/ar/analyze-exec.md
Step: Step N: [Step Title]

Accomplishment Report:
[Report what was accomplished with CONCRETE EVIDENCE. The step-verifier will independently verify these claims by reading files, checking git status, etc.

**MANDATORY Evidence Requirements:**
- **File Changes**: Include actual file paths, line numbers, and git diff output showing exact changes
- **Command Execution**: Include full command output, exit codes, test results with specific test names
- **Documentation Updates**: Include file paths, section names, actual content snippets, git diff output
- **Git Status**: Include actual `git status` and `git diff` output showing what changed
- **Verification Output**: Include actual grep/search command output proving claims
- **Build/Test Results**: Include full output showing compilation, test execution, memory leak reports

**Examples:**
✅ GOOD: "Updated `.opencode/command/ar/execute-plan.md` line 2356: `git diff` shows lines changed from `### If progress tracking` to `### If step tracking`. Verification: `grep -i 'checkpoint' file.md` returned no matches (exit code 1)"
❌ BAD: "Updated execute-plan.md to remove checkpoint references"

See [kb/sub-agent-verification-pattern.md](../../../kb/sub-agent-verification-pattern.md) for complete evidence requirements and examples.]"
```

**CRITICAL**: 
- Report accomplishments with **concrete evidence** (file paths, line numbers, command outputs, git diff, test results), NOT instructions or vague summaries
- The step-verifier independently verifies by reading command files, checking files, git status/diff, etc.
- If step-verifier reports "⚠️ STOP EXECUTION", you MUST fix issues before proceeding
- If accomplishment report lacks concrete evidence, step-verifier will STOP execution and require evidence "⚠️ STOP EXECUTION", you MUST fix issues before proceeding

## MANDATORY: Initialize All Todo Items

**CRITICAL**: Before executing ANY steps, add ALL step and verification todo items to the session todo list using `todo_write`:

**Step and Verification Todo Items:**
- Add todo item: "Step 1: Build Executable" - Status: pending
- Add todo item: "Verify Step 1: Build Executable" - Status: pending
- Add todo item: "Step 2: Run Static Analysis" - Status: pending
- Add todo item: "Verify Step 2: Run Static Analysis" - Status: pending
- Add todo item: "Step 3: Report Results" - Status: pending
- Add todo item: "Verify Step 3: Report Results" - Status: pending
- Add todo item: "Verify Complete Workflow: analyze-exec" - Status: pending

**Important**: All todo items are initialized as `pending` and will be updated to `in_progress` when their respective step/verification begins, then to `completed` after verification passes.

## Workflow Execution

Run the complete workflow:

```bash
./scripts/run-analyze-exec.sh
```

This script handles all stages of the executable static analysis process:

### What the Script Does

1. **Build Executable**: Compiles the executable if needed
2. **Run Static Analysis**: Executes static analysis tools on the executable code
3. **Report Results**: Presents analysis findings and code quality metrics
4. **Completion**: Marks the workflow as complete

## Troubleshooting

If the script fails, simply rerun it:

```bash
./scripts/run-analyze-exec.sh
```

## Minimum Requirements

**MANDATORY for successful completion:**
- [ ] Command executes without errors
- [ ] Expected output is produced
- [ ] No unexpected warnings or issues

**CRITICAL**: Always use `2>&1` to capture all analyzer output. Static analysis can reveal bugs that tests don't catch.

**Before running**: Ensure you have clang installed. The analyzer checks for:
- NULL pointer dereferences
- Use-after-free
- Resource leaks
- Dead code
- Logic errors

**Questions to consider**:
- Are there any unchecked return values?
- Do all malloc calls have corresponding frees?
- Are there any unreachable code blocks?

```bash
# Verify ready to execute
```

**Expected gate output:**
```
✅ GATE 'Ready' - PASSED
   Verified: Steps 1
```

## Command

```bash
make analyze-exec 2>&1

# Mark execution complete
```

## Expected Output

    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

```

**Dead Code:**
```

## Key Points

- **Clang Static Analyzer** checks executable and dependencies
- **Critical issues**: NULL dereferences cause exit code 1
- **Warnings**: Unchecked returns and dead code are non-blocking
- **Comprehensive**: Analyzes entire dependency tree
- **Always use `2>&1`** to capture all analyzer output
