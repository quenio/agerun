Safely merge local settings into main settings file with checkpoint tracking.

**Note**: This workflow uses checkpoint tracking for safe multi-step integration with quality gates ([details](../../../kb/settings-file-merging-pattern.md)). The stats file management has been optimized with whitespace trimming ([details](../../../kb/multi-step-checkpoint-tracking-pattern.md)) to ensure reliable execution.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize the merge workflow
./scripts/checkpoint-init.sh merge-settings "Check Files" "Read Settings" "Merge Permissions" "Validate Result" "Refactor Permissions" "Commit and Cleanup"

# Follow checkpoint steps as indicated
./scripts/checkpoint-status.sh merge-settings
```

# Merge Settings

## CHECKPOINT WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT

**CRITICAL**: This command MUST use checkpoint tracking for ALL execution.

### In-Progress Workflow Detection

If a `/merge-settings` workflow is already in progress:

```bash
./scripts/checkpoint-status.sh merge-settings --verbose
# Resume: ./scripts/checkpoint-update.sh merge-settings N
# Or reset: ./scripts/checkpoint-cleanup.sh merge-settings && ./scripts/checkpoint-init.sh merge-settings "Check Files" "Read Settings" "Merge Permissions" "Validate Result" "Refactor Permissions" "Commit and Cleanup"
```

### First-Time Initialization Check

```bash
./scripts/checkpoint-init.sh merge-settings "Check Files" "Read Settings" "Merge Permissions" "Validate Result" "Refactor Permissions" "Commit and Cleanup"
```

## PRECONDITION: Checkpoint Tracking Must Be Initialized

```bash
./scripts/checkpoint-require.sh merge-settings
```

## Overview

This command uses checkpoint tracking to ensure safe merging of local settings into the main settings file. The process has 6 checkpoints across 4 phases with verification gates.

The workflow:
1. **Discovery Phase** - Detect local settings file and plan merge strategy
2. **Merge Phase** - Read, merge, and validate settings with quality gates
3. **Optimization Phase** - Refactor permissions to generic patterns
4. **Cleanup Phase** - Commit and push all changes

## Checkpoint Tracking

### Initialize Tracking
```bash
# Start the settings merge process
./scripts/checkpoint-init.sh merge-settings "Check Files" "Read Settings" "Merge Permissions" "Validate Result" "Refactor Permissions" "Commit and Cleanup"
```

**Expected output:**
```
üìç Starting: merge-settings (6 steps)
üìÅ Tracking: /tmp/merge-settings-progress.txt
‚Üí Run: ./scripts/checkpoint-update.sh merge-settings 1
```

### Check Progress at Any Time

```bash
./scripts/checkpoint-status.sh merge-settings
```

**Expected output (example at 60% completion):**
```
üìà merge-settings: X/Y steps (Z%)
   [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë] Z%
‚Üí Next: ./scripts/checkpoint-update.sh merge-settings N
```

### Expected Outputs

**Step 1 - Check Files:**
```
‚úÖ Local settings file found
   Local permissions to merge:       19
```

**Step 2 - Read Settings:**
```
‚úÖ Settings files read
   Main file permissions:      135
```

**Step 3 - Merge Permissions:**
```
‚úÖ Permissions merged
Merge Statistics:
  Main permissions:   140
  Local permissions:  21
  Merged permissions: 161
  New permissions:    21
```

**Step 4 - Validate Result:**
```
‚úÖ Merged settings are valid JSON
```

**Final Completion:**
```

#### Operation 2: Update Checkpoint

```bash
./scripts/checkpoint-update.sh merge-settings 2
```

#### [CHECKPOINT END - STEP 2]

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Issues

**Problem: Checkpoint not found / tracking file missing**
```bash
# Solution: Initialize checkpoint tracking
./scripts/checkpoint-init.sh merge-settings "Check Files" "Read Settings" "Merge Permissions" "Validate Result" "Refactor Permissions" "Commit and Cleanup"
```

**Problem: Resume existing workflow**
```bash
# Check status
./scripts/checkpoint-status.sh merge-settings --verbose

# Continue from next pending step
./scripts/checkpoint-update.sh merge-settings N  # where N is the next step number
```

**Problem: Start fresh (discard previous progress)**
```bash
# Clean up old tracking
./scripts/checkpoint-cleanup.sh merge-settings

# Re-initialize
./scripts/checkpoint-init.sh merge-settings "Check Files" "Read Settings" "Merge Permissions" "Validate Result" "Refactor Permissions" "Commit and Cleanup"
```

### Merge Issues

**Problem: Local settings file not found**
```bash
# This is normal - the workflow handles both cases
# With local file: performs merge
# Without local file: workflow reports nothing to merge and completes
```

**Problem: Permission conflicts during merge**
```bash
# The merge operation uses deduplication logic
# Examine the merge statistics output to see conflicts resolved
# Check .claude/settings.json for merged permissions
```

**Problem: Invalid JSON after merge**
```bash
# Solution: The validation step catches this
# Check the settings.json file for syntax errors:
python3 -m json.tool .claude/settings.json

# If validation fails, the workflow will stop at Step 4
# Fix the JSON file and re-run the workflow
```

**Problem: Stats file whitespace errors (line N: XX: command not found)**
```bash
# Solution: This was fixed in recent versions
# Update scripts if you see this error:
git pull origin main

# Clean and retry:
./scripts/checkpoint-cleanup.sh merge-settings
./scripts/checkpoint-init.sh merge-settings "Check Files" "Read Settings" "Merge Permissions" "Validate Result" "Refactor Permissions" "Commit and Cleanup"
```

### Common Solutions

**View current workflow state:**
```bash
./scripts/checkpoint-status.sh merge-settings --verbose
cat /tmp/merge-settings-progress.txt
cat /tmp/merge-settings-stats.txt
```

**Debug script execution:**
```bash
# Run individual step manually to see errors
./scripts/check-settings-local-file.sh
./scripts/read-settings-files.sh
./scripts/merge-permissions.sh
./scripts/validate-merged-settings.sh
```

**Verify merged settings:**
```bash
# Check merged permissions count
grep '"Bash(' ./.claude/settings.json | wc -l

# Validate JSON syntax
python3 -m json.tool ./.claude/settings.json > /dev/null && echo "‚úÖ Valid JSON"

# Check for local file removal
[ -f ./.claude/settings.local.json ] && echo "‚ùå Local file still exists" || echo "‚úÖ Local file removed"
```
