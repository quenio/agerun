# Requirement Precision in TDD

## Learning
Initial implementation assumptions can deviate significantly from actual requirements. During TDD cycles, it's critical to verify exact requirements before implementing, as misunderstandings lead to code that must be completely removed. User feedback often reveals that we've added unnecessary complexity based on incorrect assumptions.

## Importance
Precise requirement understanding prevents:
- Wasted implementation effort on unwanted features
- Complex code that needs complete removal
- Test pollution with unnecessary scenarios
- Architecture decisions based on false premises
- Accumulated technical debt from unused code paths

## Example
```c
// WRONG: Initial assumption - executable creates agents
int ar_executable__main(void) {
    ar_methodology_t *mut_methodology = /* ... */;
    
    // BAD: This was never required!
    ar_agent_t *own_bootstrap = ar_agency__create_agent("bootstrap", "1.0.0");
    ar_agent_t *own_echo = ar_agency__create_agent("echo", "1.0.0");
    
    // BAD: Saving was not required either!
    ar_agency__save_agents(mut_agency, "agerun.agency");
}

// RIGHT: After clarification - executable only loads methods
int ar_executable__main(void) {
    ar_methodology_t *mut_methodology = /* ... */;
    
    // Only load methods from directory
    _load_methods_from_directory(mut_methodology);
    
    // No agent creation (except bootstrap in future cycle)
    // No persistence file handling
}
```

## Generalization
Before implementing any TDD cycle:
1. Write down exact requirements in test comments
2. Question assumptions: "Does this really need to do X?"
3. Implement ONLY what's explicitly required
4. Listen carefully to user corrections - they reveal misunderstandings
5. Remove code eagerly when requirements change
6. Keep cycles minimal - add complexity only when asked

## Implementation
```c
// In test, document exact requirements
static void test_cycle_requirement(void) {
    // Given: State exact preconditions
    // When: Describe ONLY required action
    // Then: Verify ONLY required outcome
    
    // NOT required for this cycle:
    // - Agent creation
    // - File persistence
    // - Message processing
}

// When user says "not required", remove immediately:
// git diff  # Review what needs removal
// Remove all related code
// Simplify test to match actual requirement
```
