# New Learnings Complete Integration Pattern

## Learning
The /new-learnings command requires comprehensive integration steps beyond just creating KB articles. Missing cross-references and command updates means the knowledge isn't properly connected to the existing system, reducing its discoverability and utility. A complete execution must include bidirectional cross-references and slash command enhancements.

## Importance
Knowledge that isn't properly integrated is effectively lost. Cross-references create a web of knowledge that makes patterns discoverable. Command updates ensure new patterns are applied in practice. Without these integration steps, valuable learnings remain isolated and unused.

## Example
```bash
# INCOMPLETE execution (what often happens):
1. Create new KB articles ✓
2. Update AGENTS.md ✓
3. Update kb/README.md ✓
4. Commit and push ✓
Missing: Cross-references ✗
Missing: Command updates ✗

# COMPLETE execution (what should happen):
1. Create new KB articles ✓
2. Add cross-references FROM new articles TO existing ✓
3. Add cross-references FROM existing articles TO new ✓
4. Search and update relevant slash commands ✓
5. Update AGENTS.md ✓
6. Update kb/README.md ✓
7. Validate all documentation ✓
8. Commit with detailed message ✓
```

## Generalization
**Complete Integration Checklist**:

### 1. KB Article Creation
- [ ] Create new articles with real AgeRun examples
- [ ] Add Related Patterns section to each new article

### 2. Bidirectional Cross-References (CRITICAL - OFTEN MISSED)
- [ ] For each new article, list what it should reference
- [ ] Search existing articles that should reference the new ones
- [ ] Update existing articles with references to new patterns
- [ ] Verify bidirectional linking

### 3. Slash Command Updates (CRITICAL - OFTEN MISSED)
- [ ] Search commands for relevant keywords
- [ ] Identify commands that could use new patterns
- [ ] Add references with `([details](actual-pattern-file.md))` // EXAMPLE: Replace with actual filename
- [ ] Update command logic if patterns change approach

### 4. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update AGENTS.md with pattern references
- [ ] Update kb/README.md index
- [ ] Update TODO.md if relevant
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md

### 5. Validation
- [ ] Run `make check-docs`
- [ ] Verify all links work
- [ ] Check cross-reference completeness

## Implementation
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Complete integration verification script

echo "=== New KB Articles Created ==="
git status | grep "new file.*kb.*\.md"

echo "=== Cross-References Added ==="
for article in $(git diff --name-only | grep "kb.*\.md"); do
    echo "References in $article:"
    grep "## Related Patterns" -A 10 "$article"
done

echo "=== Commands Updated ==="
git diff --name-only | grep ".claude/commands"

echo "=== Missing Cross-References Check ==="
# Find articles that might need cross-references
for new_article in $(git status --short | grep "^A.*kb" | cut -d' ' -f2); do
    keyword=$(basename "$new_article" .md | tr '-' ' ')
    echo "Articles that might reference $new_article:"
    grep -l "$keyword" kb/*.md | grep -v "$new_article"
done

echo "=== Commands That Might Need Updates ==="
# Check for commands with relevant keywords
keywords="priority|task|planning|estimation|report"
grep -l "$keywords" .claude/commands/*.md
```

## Common Integration Failures
1. **Creating articles in isolation**: No references to/from existing patterns
2. **Forgetting command updates**: New patterns not applied in practice
3. **One-way references**: New articles reference old, but not vice versa
4. **Missing AGENTS.md updates**: Patterns not discoverable in main guide
5. **Incomplete commit messages**: Not listing all integration work done

## Prevention Strategy
1. **Use a checklist**: Follow the complete integration checklist above
2. **Search before committing**: `grep -l "keyword" kb/*.md .claude/commands/*.md`
3. **Review git diff**: Ensure changes span multiple directories
4. **Explicit verification**: State "Added X cross-references, updated Y commands"

## Quality Indicators
Signs of complete integration:
- Git diff shows changes in kb/, .claude/commands/, and AGENTS.md
- Commit message lists cross-references and command updates
- New patterns appear in multiple existing documents
- Commands reference new KB articles
