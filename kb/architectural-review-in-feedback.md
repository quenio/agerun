# Architectural Review in Feedback

## Learning

User feedback often reveals architectural insights beyond the immediate problem. When users point out that changes "tell a bigger story," they're identifying that tactical fixes (like memory leaks) required strategic transformations (like API migrations). This feedback serves as architectural review, helping recognize the full scope of work accomplished.

## Importance

This pattern helps:
- Recognize when small fixes require large architectural changes
- Document the true scope of transformations
- Understand the relationship between symptoms and root causes
- Value user perspective as architectural oversight

## Example

```c
// Initial focus: Fix memory leaks in ar_executable.c
// User feedback: "The commit was not just about the memory leaks"

// What actually happened - complete architectural transformation:

// 1. Migration to instance-based APIs throughout codebase
ar_system_t *mut_system = ar_system__create();
ar_agency_t *mut_agency = ar_system__get_agency(mut_system);
ar_methodology_t *mut_methodology = ar_agency__get_methodology(mut_agency);

// 2. Removal of global state dependencies
// Before: ar_system__init(); ar_system__shutdown();  // EXAMPLE: Global APIs removed
// After: ar_system__init(mut_system, "main", "1.0.0");
//        ar_system__shutdown(mut_system);

// 3. Test infrastructure updates
ar_method_fixture_t *own_fixture = ar_method_fixture__create();
ar_system_t *mut_system = ar_method_fixture__get_system(own_fixture);
// All tests now manage instances explicitly

// 4. Module cleanup - removed 6,730 lines
// Deleted: ar_instruction.c, ar_instruction.h, ar_instruction.md
// Deleted: ar_instruction_fixture module
// These were obsolete after the architectural change
```

## Generalization

When receiving user feedback about scope:
1. Step back from the immediate problem
2. Review all changes made to solve it
3. Identify architectural patterns in the solution
4. Document the strategic transformation, not just tactical fixes
5. Update commit messages to reflect true scope

## Questioning Fundamental Assumptions

User feedback often challenges core assumptions, leading to architectural simplification:

**Example progression**:
1. Bug report: "System sends duplicate wake messages"
2. User question: "Who should send the wake message?"
3. Deeper question: "Which module should be responsible for agent lifecycle?"
4. Fundamental insight: "Are wake/sleep messages even necessary?"
5. Architectural decision: Remove the feature entirely

This questioning pattern transforms bug fixes into architectural improvements by:
- Challenging whether features are essential
- Identifying optional complexity
- Simplifying system design
- Reducing maintenance burden

**Another example - Test complexity**:
1. Initial approach: Complex malloc interception with retry loops
2. User feedback: "Why is that necessary?"
3. Investigation: Checked other dlsym tests
4. Discovery: They mock at function level, not system calls
5. Architectural insight: Mock at the right abstraction level

## Implementation

```bash
# When user says changes tell a bigger story:

# 1. Review full diff statistics
git diff --stat

# 2. Look for architectural indicators
git diff | grep -E "(create|destroy|_with_instance|global)" | wc -l

# 3. Check for module additions/deletions
git status | grep -E "(deleted:|new file:)" | wc -l

# 4. Identify systematic changes
find . -name "*.c" -o -name "*.h" | xargs grep -l "instance" | wc -l

# 5. Document the transformation properly
git commit --amend  # Update to reflect architectural scope
```
