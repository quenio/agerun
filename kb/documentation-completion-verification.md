# Documentation Completion Verification

## Learning
Always verify that TODO.md and CHANGELOG.md are updated as part of the commit that completes a task. Missing these updates requires a follow-up commit and breaks the atomic nature of task completion.

## Importance
Complete documentation in the same commit ensures:
- Atomic task completion with full documentation
- Accurate project history tracking
- No forgotten documentation updates
- Clear record of what was accomplished
- Easier project management and review

## Example
```bash
# After completing TDD Cycle 7, we initially committed without docs:
git show --stat HEAD
# Output showed:
# SPEC.md, bootstrap-1.0.0.method, tests, evaluators
# BUT missing: TODO.md and CHANGELOG.md

# Had to create follow-up commit:
git commit -m "docs: update TODO.md and CHANGELOG.md for TDD Cycle 7 completion"
```

Proper workflow:
```bash
# Before committing implementation:
1. Update TODO.md with completion entry
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with achievement details
3. Include both in the same commit as implementation
```

## Generalization
Documentation completion checklist:
1. **TODO.md**: Add entry to "Completed Tasks" section with date
2. **CHANGELOG.md**: Add detailed entry under current date
3. **Commit together**: Include docs in implementation commit
4. **Verify**: Check `git status` shows TODO.md and CHANGELOG.md staged

Format for TODO.md:
```markdown
### Task Name - Cycle N (Completed YYYY-MM-DD)
- [x] Brief description of what was accomplished
```

Format for CHANGELOG.md:
```markdown
### âœ… Task Name - Cycle N
- Detailed bullet points of changes
- Technical specifics
- Test results
```

## Implementation
```bash
# Add to pre-commit verification:
git status | grep -E "(TODO|CHANGELOG)\.md"

# If missing, add them:
git add TODO.md CHANGELOG.md

# Can also amend if just committed:
git commit --amend
```
