# Test Memory Leak Ownership Analysis

## Learning
Memory leaks detected in tests aren't always from the code under test. They often come from test setup resources that have their own lifecycle management. Understanding the complete ownership chain and cleanup sequence is crucial before adding manual cleanup calls.

## Importance
This prevents adding redundant cleanup code that obscures the actual ownership model. It also helps distinguish between real memory leaks that need fixing and expected resource management handled by system lifecycle.

## Example
```c
// Test creating methods that are owned by methodology
static void test_agency_functionality(void) {
    // Create and register a method
    ar_method_t *own_method = ar_method__create("test_method", "message -> \"Test\"", "1.0.0");
    ar_methodology__register_method(own_method);  // Ownership transferred to methodology
    
    // Run test operations...
    int64_t agent_id = ar_agency__create_agent("test_method", "1.0.0", NULL);
    
    // Initially added manual cleanup (redundant):
    ar_methodology__unregister_method("test_method", "1.0.0");  // NOT NEEDED
    
    // System shutdown cleans up methodology and all registered methods
    ar_system__shutdown();  // Calls ar_methodology__cleanup() which frees all methods
}
```

## Generalization
When analyzing memory leaks in tests:
1. First understand the complete ownership chain
2. Check if resources are managed by system lifecycle functions
3. Only add manual cleanup for resources not covered by existing lifecycle
4. Document why certain cleanups are or aren't needed

## Implementation
```bash
# Check memory leak reports for source
cat bin/run-tests/memory_report_*.log | grep "Allocated at:"

# Trace ownership chain
grep -r "ar_methodology__register_method" modules/
grep -r "ar_methodology__cleanup" modules/

# Verify lifecycle management
grep -A 10 "ar_system__shutdown" modules/ar_system.c
```
