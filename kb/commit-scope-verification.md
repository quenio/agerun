# Commit Scope Verification

## Learning

Git commits should accurately reflect the full scope of changes made, not just the immediate problem that triggered the work. Initial commit messages often focus on the specific issue (like memory leaks) while missing the broader architectural changes that were necessary to fix the issue.

## Importance

Accurate commit messages are crucial for:
- Understanding project history and evolution
- Code review and collaboration
- Future debugging and maintenance
- Documentation of major architectural decisions

## Example

```c
// Initial focus: Fix memory leaks in ar_executable.c
ar_data_t *own_context = ar_data__create_map();
ar_system__shutdown(mut_system);
ar_data__destroy(own_context);  // Fixed leak

// But the actual scope included:
// 1. Complete migration to instance-based APIs
ar_system_t *mut_system = ar_system__create();
ar_agency_t *mut_agency = ar_system__get_agency(mut_system);
ar_methodology_t *mut_methodology = ar_agency__get_methodology(mut_agency);

// 2. Removal of obsolete modules (6,730 lines)
// - Deleted ar_instruction.c, ar_instruction.h, ar_instruction.md
// - Deleted ar_instruction_fixture module

// 3. Test infrastructure updates
ar_method_fixture_t *own_fixture = ar_method_fixture__create();
ar_system_t *mut_system = ar_method_fixture__get_system(own_fixture);

// 4. Creation of migration scripts
// - scripts/update_test_system_calls.py
// - scripts/fix_system_create_calls.py
```

## Generalization

Before committing:
1. Review `git diff --stat` to see the full scope of changes
2. Check if architectural changes were made beyond the immediate fix
3. Consider if module additions/deletions indicate larger refactoring
4. Look for systematic changes that indicate API migrations
5. Amend commit messages when initial scope was too narrow

## Implementation

```bash
# Review full scope of changes
git status
git diff --stat

# Check for architectural changes
git diff | grep -E "(create|destroy|_with_instance)" | head -20

# Look for module changes
git status | grep -E "(deleted:|new file:)" 

# Amend commit if scope was too narrow
git commit --amend -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat: complete system-wide migration to instance-based APIs

Major architectural transformation eliminating global state dependencies:
- Converted ar_system to single-instance module with instance-based APIs
- Updated ar_agent_store to simplified instance-based implementation
- Fixed all memory leaks across all test files (0 leaks remaining)
- Removed obsolete ar_instruction module (~6,730 lines)
- Created 7 migration scripts for systematic updates
