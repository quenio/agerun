# Session Resumption Without Prompting

## Learning
When a session resumes from a comprehensive summary that includes "Current Work" and "Optional Next Step" sections, the assistant should immediately continue executing the last task without asking clarifying questions. The summary provides complete context for seamless continuation.

## Importance
Asking questions when resuming from a detailed summary wastes time and disrupts workflow. The entire purpose of comprehensive session summaries is to enable immediate continuation. User interruption should only occur when genuinely ambiguous situations arise that weren't documented in the summary.

## Example
```c
// Conceptual model of session resumption decision logic
// Real implementation is in AI assistant behavior

typedef struct session_summary_s {  // EXAMPLE: Conceptual model only
    char *conversation_flow;          // Complete conversation history
    ar_map_t *own_technical_details;  // Code changes, patterns, metrics
    ar_list_t *own_user_messages;     // All user interactions
    char *current_work;               // Exact state when session ended
    char *optional_next_step;         // Recommended continuation
} session_summary_t;  // EXAMPLE: Not in actual codebase

// Decision logic for session resumption
bool should_continue_without_prompting(const session_summary_t *ref_summary) {  // EXAMPLE: Conceptual function
    // Check if summary includes current work state
    bool has_current_work = (ref_summary->current_work != NULL &&
                            strlen(ref_summary->current_work) > 0);

    // Check if next step is explicitly defined
    bool has_next_step = (ref_summary->optional_next_step != NULL &&
                         strlen(ref_summary->optional_next_step) > 0);

    // Check if in middle of multi-step workflow (e.g., checkpoint-based)
    bool in_workflow = strstr(ref_summary->current_work, "Checkpoint") != NULL ||
                      strstr(ref_summary->current_work, "Step") != NULL;

    // Continue immediately if we have clear context
    if (has_current_work && (has_next_step || in_workflow)) {
        return true;  // Execute next step without asking
    }

    return false;  // Need user clarification
}

// Real session example from TDD Cycle 6 completion
void example_session_resumption() {  // EXAMPLE: Demonstration function
    // Summary included:
    // - Current Work: "At checkpoint 6/9 of the commit workflow"
    // - Optional Next Step: "Continue the commit workflow from Checkpoint 7 (Stage Files)"
    // - Complete details of all 6 completed checkpoints

    // CORRECT: Assistant resumed immediately with:
    ar_data_t *own_command1 = ar_data__create_string("git status");  // Analyze state
    ar_data_t *own_command2 = ar_data__create_string("git diff --cached");  // Check staged
    ar_data_t *own_command3 = ar_data__create_string("git add -A");  // Stage files
    // ... continued workflow without asking questions

    // INCORRECT would be:
    // "I see you were at checkpoint 6. Would you like me to continue with checkpoint 7?"
    // NO - just continue! The summary made it clear.

    // Cleanup
    ar_data__destroy(own_command1);
    ar_data__destroy(own_command2);
    ar_data__destroy(own_command3);
}
```

## Generalization
**Resumption Decision Rules:**

1. **Continue Immediately When:**
   - Summary includes "Current Work" section with state
   - Summary includes "Optional Next Step" with command/action
   - In middle of checkpoint-based workflow with progress visible
   - Last user message was a command execution request
   - All necessary context documented in summary

2. **Ask for Clarification When:**
   - Summary ends at ambiguous decision point
   - Multiple equally valid next steps exist
   - User feedback contradicted previous assumptions
   - External state may have changed (files modified outside session)
   - Summary notes uncertainty about user intent

3. **Summary Quality Indicators:**
   - Exact checkpoint number or step number provided
   - Next command to run explicitly stated
   - Progress percentage visible (e.g., "6/9 steps (66%)")
   - File states documented (what was modified, what's pending)
   - Expected output of next step described

## Implementation
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Checklist for determining if immediate continuation is appropriate

# 1. Check if summary has "Current Work" section
CURRENT_WORK_SECTION=$(grep -A 5 "## .*Current Work\|## 8\. Current Work" summary.md)

# 2. Check if summary has "Next Step" section
NEXT_STEP_SECTION=$(grep -A 5 "## .*Next Step\|## 9\. .*Next Step" summary.md)

# 3. Check for checkpoint/workflow state
CHECKPOINT_STATE=$(echo "$CURRENT_WORK_SECTION" | grep -i "checkpoint\|step.*of\|progress:")

# 4. Check for explicit command to run
EXPLICIT_COMMAND=$(echo "$NEXT_STEP_SECTION" | grep "make\|git\|bash")

# Decision logic
if [ -n "$CURRENT_WORK_SECTION" ] && [ -n "$NEXT_STEP_SECTION" ]; then
    if [ -n "$CHECKPOINT_STATE" ] || [ -n "$EXPLICIT_COMMAND" ]; then
        echo "✓ CONTINUE IMMEDIATELY: Complete context available"
        echo "Execute: $EXPLICIT_COMMAND"
        exit 0
    fi
fi

echo "⚠ ASK FOR CLARIFICATION: Insufficient context for automatic continuation"
exit 1
```

## Real Session Example

**Summary Context (TDD Cycle 6):**
- Current Work: "At checkpoint 6/9 of the commit workflow, having just reviewed all changes via `git diff`"
- Next Step: "Continue the commit workflow from Checkpoint 7 (Stage Files)"
- Progress: "6/9 steps (66%)"

**Correct Resumption (what happened):**
```
Assistant: I'll continue with the commit workflow from Checkpoint 7.

[Executes: git status]
[Executes: git diff --cached]
[Executes: git log --oneline -10]
[Executes: git add -A]
[Executes: make checkpoint-update CMD=commit STEP=7]
```

**Incorrect Resumption (what should NOT happen):**
```
Assistant: I see you were in the middle of the commit workflow at checkpoint 6.
Would you like me to continue with checkpoint 7 (Stage Files), or would you
prefer to review the changes again first?
```

This wastes the user's time and undermines the purpose of comprehensive summaries.

## Conversation Continuation Instruction

The system summary includes this explicit guidance:
> "Please continue the conversation from where we left it off **without asking the user any further questions**. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on."

This instruction should be taken literally when:
- Summary documents clear current state
- Next step is unambiguous
- No new information is needed from user
