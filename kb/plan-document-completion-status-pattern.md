# Plan Document Completion Status Pattern

## Learning
TDD plan documents serve dual purposes: implementation guide during development AND verification checklist after completion. Once a TDD cycle is fully implemented and verified, the plan document itself should be updated with a completion status header documenting what was achieved, when, and how to verify it.

## Importance
Without completion status in plan documents, there's no authoritative record of what "done" means for that cycle. Future readers can't quickly determine if the plan was followed, partially implemented, or abandoned. The completion status creates a closed-loop documentation system: plan → implement → verify → document completion in plan.

## Example
```markdown
<!-- BAD: Plan with no completion tracking -->
# TDD Cycle 6.5: Add Message Queue Infrastructure

## Overview
Implement message queuing for delegates...

## Iteration 1: Send returns success
...
```

```markdown
<!-- GOOD: Plan with completion status header -->
# TDD Cycle 6.5: Add Message Queue Infrastructure

## ✅ COMPLETION STATUS

**Status**: FULLY COMPLETED AND VERIFIED (2025-10-13)

**Implementation Results**:
- ✅ All 14 iterations completed following strict TDD methodology
- ✅ ar_delegate layer (iterations 1-6): 9 tests passing, zero memory leaks (46 allocations, 0 bytes leaked)
- ✅ ar_delegation layer (iterations 7-14): 11 tests passing, zero memory leaks (154 allocations, 0 bytes leaked)
- ✅ Perfect pattern match with ar_agent/ar_agency architecture
- ✅ Complete documentation (ar_delegate.md + ar_delegation.md)
- ✅ Commit: 668eb05 - "feat: complete delegation message queue layer (TDD Cycle 6.5)"

**Verification**: All tests use BDD structure (Given/When/Then), proper ownership semantics (take_ownership → owns while queued → drop_ownership), and zero memory leaks confirmed via memory tracking reports.

## Generalization
**Completion Status Header Format**:

```markdown
## ✅ COMPLETION STATUS

**Status**: [FULLY COMPLETED AND VERIFIED | IN PROGRESS | PARTIALLY COMPLETED | ABANDONED] (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Implementation Results**:
- ✅ [Specific achievement 1 with metrics]
- ✅ [Specific achievement 2 with metrics]
- ✅ [Pattern matching or architecture notes]
- ✅ [Documentation completeness]
- ✅ [Commit reference with hash and message]

**Verification**: [How completion was verified - tools, tests, comparisons]

---
```

### Status Values:
- **FULLY COMPLETED AND VERIFIED**: All iterations done, verified against plan, documented
- **IN PROGRESS**: Some iterations complete, work continuing
- **PARTIALLY COMPLETED**: Work stopped before all iterations complete
- **ABANDONED**: Plan not pursued, replaced by alternative approach

### Metrics to Include:
- **Iteration count**: "All 14 iterations completed"
- **Test results**: "9 tests passing" / "78 tests, 0 failures"
- **Memory safety**: "zero memory leaks (154 allocations, 0 bytes leaked)"
- **Performance**: "Clean build: 1m 31s"
- **Pattern compliance**: "Perfect pattern match with ar_agent/ar_agency"
- **Documentation**: "Complete documentation (list files)"

### Commit Reference:
- Include full commit hash (first 7 chars minimum)
- Include commit message for context
- Format: `Commit: abcd123 - "commit message"`

## Implementation
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script to generate completion status for plan document

PLAN_FILE=$1
COMPLETION_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Extract metrics from recent work
TEST_COUNT=$(grep -c "PASS" /tmp/test_output.log)
MEMORY_LEAKS=$(grep "Actual memory leaks:" bin/run-tests/memory_report_*.log | grep -o "[0-9]* (")
COMMIT_HASH=$(git log -1 --format="%h")
COMMIT_MSG=$(git log -1 --format="%s")

# Generate completion header
cat > /tmp/completion_header.md <<EOF
## ✅ COMPLETION STATUS

**Status**: FULLY COMPLETED AND VERIFIED ($COMPLETION_DATE)

**Implementation Results**:
- ✅ All iterations completed following strict TDD methodology
- ✅ Test suite: $TEST_COUNT tests passing, zero memory leaks
- ✅ [Add pattern matching notes]
- ✅ [Add documentation notes]
- ✅ Commit: $COMMIT_HASH - "$COMMIT_MSG"

**Verification**: [Add verification methods used]

---
EOF

# Insert at beginning of plan (after title)
sed -i '' '2r /tmp/completion_header.md' "$PLAN_FILE"
```

### Manual Update Process:
1. **After verifying completion**: Open plan document for editing
2. **Add header after title**: Insert completion status section
3. **Document specific achievements**: List iterations, tests, memory results
4. **Reference verification method**: How you confirmed completion
5. **Link to commit**: Include commit hash and message
6. **Separate from plan**: Use horizontal rule (`---`) to separate status from original plan

## Benefits
1. **Quick status check**: See at a glance if plan was completed
2. **Historical record**: Know when and how work was done
3. **Verification reference**: See what "done" means for this plan
4. **Audit trail**: Link to commit that implemented the plan
5. **Quality metrics**: Record test counts, memory safety, performance
6. **Pattern documentation**: Note which patterns were followed

## Integration with Workflow
```bash
# During TDD cycle execution:
1. Follow plan iterations 1 → N
2. Run tests after each iteration
3. Verify memory safety throughout

# After all iterations complete:
1. Run comprehensive verification (see tdd-cycle-completion-verification-pattern.md)
2. Commit all changes
3. Update plan document with completion status
4. Include metrics from verification
5. Reference the commit that completed the work

# Plan document now serves as:
- Implementation guide (for future similar work)
- Completion verification record (proof of done)
- Quality benchmark (metrics for comparison)
```

## Quality Indicators
A well-documented completion status includes:
- ✅ Specific date of completion
- ✅ Quantitative metrics (test counts, memory metrics, timing)
- ✅ Verification method explained
- ✅ Commit reference with context
- ✅ Pattern adherence notes
- ✅ Documentation completeness confirmation

## Common Mistakes
1. **Vague status**: "Status: Complete" without details
2. **No metrics**: Missing test counts, memory verification
3. **No commit link**: Can't trace implementation
4. **No verification method**: How was completion confirmed?
5. **Missing date**: When was this completed?
