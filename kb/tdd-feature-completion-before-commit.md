# TDD Feature Completion Before Commit

## Learning
When implementing a feature using TDD with multiple cycles, ALL cycles must be completed before committing. This means implementing every planned behavior through its full Red-Green-Refactor cycle, updating documentation, and only then creating a single commit for the complete feature.

## Importance
- Ensures atomic, complete features in each commit
- Prevents partially implemented features in the codebase
- Maintains clean git history with meaningful commits
- Makes code review easier with complete, logical changes
- Facilitates reverting if needed without breaking functionality

## Example
When implementing ar_method_registry with 11 planned TDD cycles:

```c
// TDD Cycle 1: Create/Destroy
// RED → GREEN → REFACTOR (no commit)

// TDD Cycle 2: Register method  
// RED → GREEN → REFACTOR (no commit)

// ... Cycles 3-10 ...
// Each completed fully (no commits)

// TDD Cycle 11: Update ar_methodology to use registry
// RED → GREEN → REFACTOR (no commit)

// ONLY NOW: After ALL 11 cycles complete
// 1. Update documentation (ar_method_registry.md)
// 2. Update TODO.md (mark completed)
// 3. Update CHANGELOG.md
// 4. git commit -m "feat: complete Phase 1 of methodology module refactoring"
```

## Generalization
For any feature implementation:
1. Plan all required TDD cycles upfront
2. Execute each cycle completely (Red-Green-Refactor)
3. Do NOT commit between cycles
4. After ALL cycles complete:
   - Update module documentation
   - Update TODO.md 
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
   - Create single atomic commit

## Implementation
```bash
# WRONG: Committing after each cycle
make test_name  # Cycle 1
git commit -m "feat: add create/destroy"  # NO!

# RIGHT: Complete all cycles first
make test_name  # Cycles 1-N
# ... implement all planned behaviors ...
# Update docs
git commit -m "feat: complete feature implementation"
```

Key indicators you're ready to commit:
- All planned TDD cycles complete
- All tests passing with zero memory leaks  
- Documentation updated
- No more "pending" items for this feature
