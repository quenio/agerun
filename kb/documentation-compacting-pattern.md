# Documentation Compacting Pattern

## Learning
How to effectively compress verbose documentation by extracting detailed content to knowledge base articles while maintaining essential information and adding links for deeper exploration.

## Importance
Long, detailed documentation in main guidelines creates cognitive overload and makes it harder to quickly find and follow essential rules. Compacting improves scanability while preserving comprehensive information.

## Example
**Reference documentation compaction (AGENTS.md)**:
```markdown
// Before (in AGENTS.md - 15 lines):
**Memory Leak Detection**:
- Full test suite: Check console for "WARNING: X memory leaks detected"
- Individual test memory reports: Located at `bin/memory_report_<test_name>.log`
  - IMPORTANT: No longer uses generic `heap_memory_report.log`
  - Each test generates its own report file automatically
  - Example: `bin/memory_report_ar_string_tests.log`
  - Workflow: `make test_name` → Check test-specific memory report
- Complete verification: `grep "Actual memory leaks:" bin/memory_report_*.log | grep -v "0 (0 bytes)"`
- Always run `make sanitize-tests` before committing
- Environment variables for debugging:
  - `ASAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=0` to continue after first error
  - `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1:leak_check_at_exit=1` for complex leaks

// After (in AGENTS.md - 3 lines):
**Memory Leak Detection**:
- Check test reports: `bin/memory_report_<test_name>.log` ([details](memory-leak-detection-workflow.md))
- Always run `make sanitize-tests` before committing
- Debug strategy: Check report → Trace source → Fix naming → Add cleanup ([details](memory-debugging-comprehensive-guide.md))
```

**Historical record compaction (CHANGELOG.md) - Multi-line format (CURRENT STANDARD)**:
```markdown
// Before (verbose multi-line - 25 lines):
- **Feature Name**

  Long descriptive paragraph explaining what was done in great detail with
  multiple sentences covering implementation specifics that could be more
  concise while still maintaining clarity and readability for future reference.

  **Implementation Details**: Long paragraph about technical implementation
  with excessive detail about every single file that was modified and every
  single function that was changed and exactly how many lines were added.

  **Additional Context**: Even more verbose explanation of context and
  background information that could be summarized more concisely.

  **Quality Metrics**: Detailed test results with unnecessary verbosity

  **Impact**: Long explanation of impact

// After (concise multi-line - 12 lines):
- **Feature Name**

  Brief overview paragraph with key information.

  **Implementation**: Core modules modified (ar_system.c, ar_agency.h),
  added 3 functions, updated 12 tests

  **Quality**: Clean build, 78 tests passing, zero leaks

  **Impact**: Clear outcome statement

**Key**: Maintain multi-line structure for readability, reduce verbosity
within each section
```

**Historical record compaction (CHANGELOG.md) - Semantic grouping across dates**:
```markdown
// Before (200+ entries across multiple dates):
## 2025-08-23
- System module analysis revealed architectural issues
- Identified 5 responsibilities violating SRP
- Documented analysis in reports/

## 2025-08-15
- Continued system module analysis
- Created KB articles for patterns found
- Updated documentation

## 2025-08-10
- Further system module analysis 
- Comprehensive review complete
- ...continues for 200+ more entries...

// After (single coherent entry with date range):
## 2025-08-23 to 2025-03-01
- **System Module Architecture Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis across 200+ entries revealing architectural patterns, critical issues, and improvement opportunities; **KB Enhancement**: Added 12+ new articles covering system design patterns, error propagation, and development practices; **Impact**: Established clear architectural foundation with quantified improvement roadmap
```

**Key difference**: Scripts can do the first example (mechanical combination). Only humans can do the second example (semantic analysis to identify that entries from different dates are actually the same work and should be grouped).


**Mixed-state document compaction (TODO.md) - Selective compaction**:
```markdown
// Before:
### Agency Module Instantiation (Completed 2025-08-01)
- [x] Made ar_agency module instantiable with opaque type and instance-based API
- [x] Converted global state to instance fields while maintaining backward compatibility
- [x] Added create/destroy functions and instance-based versions of all API functions
- [x] Created global instance pattern similar to ar_methodology for seamless migration
- [x] Added comprehensive test for instance-based API
- [x] Updated documentation to describe both global and instance-based APIs
- [x] Verified zero memory leaks from agency module (methodology leaks are expected)

### 4. Complete Agent Store Load Implementation
**Rationale**: The agent store save functionality works correctly...
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Design load coordination between agency and agent store
  - [ ] Agency provides method lookup during load operation
  - [ ] Agent store requests method by name/version from agency
  - [ ] Handle missing methods gracefully with warnings

// After (only completed task compacted, incomplete preserved):
### Agency Module Instantiation (Completed 2025-08-01)
- [x] Made ar_agency module instantiable with opaque type and instance-based API; converted global state to instance fields while maintaining backward compatibility; added create/destroy functions and instance-based versions of all API functions; created global instance pattern similar to ar_methodology for seamless migration; added comprehensive test for instance-based API; updated documentation to describe both global and instance-based APIs; verified zero memory leaks from agency module (methodology leaks are expected)

### 4. Complete Agent Store Load Implementation
**Rationale**: The agent store save functionality works correctly...
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Design load coordination between agency and agent store
  - [ ] Agency provides method lookup during load operation
  - [ ] Agent store requests method by name/version from agency
  - [ ] Handle missing methods gracefully with warnings
  
  ↑ INCOMPLETE SECTION REMAINS 100% UNTOUCHED - structure, whitespace, sub-items all preserved
```

**Key principle**: Selective compaction = compact completed items + manual semantic analysis + preserve incomplete items completely.

## Generalization
**When to compact**:
- Section exceeds 10-15 lines
- Contains detailed examples or code snippets
- Includes step-by-step procedures
- Has multiple sub-bullets explaining concepts

**How to compact - Strategy depends on document type**:

**For CHANGELOG.md (multi-line format) - CURRENT STANDARD**:
1. **ALWAYS maintain multi-line format** - do NOT compress to single lines
2. Reduce verbosity WITHIN sections, not by combining sections
3. Compress verbose paragraphs to brief summaries (2-3 sentences max)
4. Use concise labels (**Implementation**, **Quality**, **Impact** vs. verbose headers)
5. Combine related bullet lists into compact prose
6. Remove redundant qualifying statements ("that was", "which is", "in order to")
7. **Target**: 30-50% reduction by trimming verbosity, NOT by removing structure

**Example of CORRECT multi-line compaction**:
```markdown
// WRONG (converts to single-line - hard to read):
- **Feature**: Implementation details; quality metrics; impact statement; more details; even more stuff

// RIGHT (maintains multi-line - readable and concise):
- **Feature**

  Brief summary of what was done.

  **Implementation**: Key changes without excessive detail

  **Impact**: Clear outcome
```

**For reference documentation (e.g., AGENTS.md)**:
1. Identify core actionable rules (keep these)
2. **PRESERVE ALL EXISTING KB REFERENCES** - they ARE the detailed docs
3. Create KB articles BEFORE adding any links to them
4. Extract examples, details, explanations to kb article
5. Summarize verbose content in 1-2 lines
6. Add `([details](kb/article.md))` link // EXAMPLE: Link format
7. Update existing KB articles to reference new ones (bidirectional)
8. Ensure critical commands/rules remain visible

**For historical records (e.g., CHANGELOG.md)**:

**CRITICAL - Automation Limitations** (learned 2025-10-08):
- Automated scripts achieve only 10-20% reduction through mechanical tasks (combining bullets, removing blanks)
- Scripts **CANNOT** perform semantic analysis needed for 40-50% reduction
- Scripts cannot identify related entries across different dates
- Scripts cannot rewrite verbose repetition into coherent summaries
- **Achieving 40-50% requires manual semantic analysis and intelligent rewriting**

**Manual compaction strategies**:
1. Preserve chronological order - never extract to external files
2. **Identify repetitive patterns**: Look for same work across multiple dates (e.g., "System Module Analysis" spanning 2025-08-23 to 2025-03-01)
3. **Combine related entries**: Group entries describing the same architectural work
4. **Group date ranges**: Create range entries (e.g., "2025-09-27 to 2025-09-13" for Global API Removal)
5. **Rewrite coherently**: Transform repetitive bullets into cohesive summaries
6. Keep all dates, metrics, and key transitions inline
7. Target 40-50% file size reduction (not just line reduction)
8. Example: "Fixed X; resolved Y; updated Z" instead of 3 bullets

**For mixed-state documents (e.g., TODO.md)**:

**Selective Compaction + Manual Analysis** (learned 2025-10-08):
- Selective compaction determines **what** to compact (completed vs. incomplete)
- Manual semantic analysis determines **how** to compact completed items
- **MANDATORY**: ALL incomplete [ ] tasks remain 100% untouched (not even whitespace)

**Process**:
1. **Categorize first**: Count completed [x] vs. incomplete [ ] tasks
2. **Apply manual analysis to completed only**: 
   - Merge sub-items into parent descriptions with semicolons
   - Combine related completed tasks if closely related
   - Preserve completion dates and metrics
3. **Preserve ALL incomplete work**: Structure, sub-items, whitespace, everything
4. **Verify integrity**: Incomplete task count must remain unchanged
5. **Target**: 10-20% reduction (lower due to preservation needs)
6. **Maintain state indicators**: [x] vs [ ] must be clear

**Key difference from pure historical records**:
- Historical records: Can compact everything → 40-50% reduction
- Mixed-state docs: Can only compact completed items → 10-20% reduction
- Both benefit from manual semantic analysis, but mixed-state has stricter constraints

See [Selective Compaction Pattern](selective-compaction-pattern.md) for preservation rules.

**What to preserve inline**:
- Mandatory requirements (MUST, MANDATORY, CRITICAL)
- Essential commands (`make` targets, git commands)
- Key file paths and naming patterns
- Error prevention rules
- All historical data in changelogs
- ALL incomplete/active work items in mixed-state documents

## When to Use Automation vs. Manual

**Automated Scripts** (10-20% reduction):
- Good for: Mechanical cleanup (combining bullets with semicolons, removing blank lines)
- Limitations: Cannot perform semantic analysis or identify patterns across dates
- Use case: Initial pass to reduce obvious redundancy
- Tools: Python/bash scripts with pattern matching and text substitution

**Manual Semantic Analysis** (40-50%+ reduction):
- Required for: Identifying and combining related work across different time periods
- Strengths: Human judgment to recognize patterns and rewrite coherently
- Use case: Historical records requiring significant reduction
- Process: Read, analyze patterns, group by theme, rewrite summaries

**Best Practice**: 
1. Start with automated script for mechanical cleanup (10-20%)
2. Follow with manual semantic analysis for deeper reduction (40-50%+)
3. For reference docs: Extract to KB articles (30-50% reduction)
4. For mixed-state docs: Selective compaction (10-20% reduction)

## Implementation

**For reference documentation**:
1. **Identify verbose sections**: Look for multi-paragraph explanations, long code examples, detailed procedures
2. **Create kb articles FIRST**: Extract detailed content following standard kb format
   - Use EXAMPLE tags for all hypothetical code
   - Validate with `make check-docs` before proceeding
3. **Preserve existing references**: NEVER remove existing KB links - they are essential
4. **Compress in main doc**: Reduce to essential points + link
5. **Update cross-references**: Add references from existing KB articles to new ones
6. **Single commit**: Commit all related changes together (KB articles + doc updates)
7. **Test readability**: Ensure compressed version still actionable without clicking links

**For historical records (manual process)**:
1. **Measure baseline**: Line count, file size, metrics count
2. **Analyze patterns**: Identify repetitive work across dates
3. **Manual compaction**: Read and edit directly, applying semantic grouping
   - Combine related entries from different dates
   - Create date range headers (e.g., "2025-09-27 to 2025-09-13")
   - Rewrite verbose bullets into coherent summaries
   - Use bold section headers for organization
4. **Verify preservation**: All metrics, dates, chronological order intact
5. **Calculate reduction**: Must achieve 40-50% file size reduction
6. **Document work**: Add self-documenting entry, update TODO.md
7. **Commit**: Single atomic commit with both files

**For mixed-state documents (manual process)**:
1. **Measure baseline**: Line count, completed vs. incomplete task counts
2. **Categorize content**: Identify all completed [x] and incomplete [ ] items
3. **Manual compaction of completed only**: Read and edit directly
   - Merge completed sub-tasks into parent descriptions
   - Combine related completed tasks with semicolons
   - Preserve completion dates and metrics
   - Apply semantic analysis ONLY to completed items
4. **Preserve ALL incomplete work**: 
   - Leave 100% untouched (structure, whitespace, everything)
   - Verify incomplete task count remains unchanged
5. **Verify preservation**: Count incomplete tasks before and after
6. **Calculate reduction**: Must achieve 10-20% line reduction
7. **Add self-entry**: Document the compaction in completed tasks section
8. **Commit**: Single atomic commit with verification

**Target reduction**: 
- Reference docs: 30-50% reduction
- Historical records: 40-50% reduction  
- Mixed-state docs: 10-20% reduction (due to preservation needs)
**Link placement**: Add at end of compressed point or inline where context needed
**Critical rule**: Create and validate KB articles BEFORE adding links to prevent broken references
**Commit strategy**: Use single commit for all related changes to keep atomic
