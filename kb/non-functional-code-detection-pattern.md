# Non-Functional Code Detection Pattern

## Context

During the wake/sleep message removal refactoring, we discovered that sleep messages in ar_agent were completely non-functional - they were being added to the agent's own queue and then immediately destroyed when the agent was destroyed.

## The Pattern

When refactoring legacy code, always verify that the code you're removing actually did something. Non-functional code can accumulate when:
1. The original implementation never worked correctly
2. Later changes broke the functionality but tests didn't catch it
3. The code path is never actually executed

## Detection Techniques

### 1. Trace Message Flow
```c
// Look for messages that are sent but never processed
ar_agent__send(mut_agent, mut_agent->agent_id, own_sleep_msg);  // Sending to self
ar_agent__destroy(own_agent);  // Agent destroyed immediately after
```

### 2. Check Queue Processing
- Messages sent to an agent's own queue right before destruction never get processed
- The system never sees these messages

### 3. Test Coverage Analysis
- If removing code doesn't break any tests, the code may be non-functional
- Especially true for lifecycle-related code that should have observable effects

## Example from AgeRun

The sleep message sending was non-functional:
```c
// Non-functional code (before removal):
if (own_agent->own_message_queue != NULL) {
    ar_data_t *own_sleep_msg = ar_data__create_string(g_sleep_message);
    if (own_sleep_msg) {
        own_sleep_msg->owns_memory = true;
        ar_agent__send(own_agent, own_agent->agent_id, own_sleep_msg);
    }
}
// Queue destroyed immediately after, message never processed
```

## Implications for Refactoring

1. **Simplifies removal**: Non-functional code can be removed without behavior changes
2. **No migration needed**: Users aren't relying on broken functionality
3. **Test updates minimal**: Tests checking for non-functional behavior can be simplified

## Key Takeaway

Before implementing complex migration strategies for removing features, verify that the features actually work. Non-functional code removal is a simple deletion, not a breaking change.
