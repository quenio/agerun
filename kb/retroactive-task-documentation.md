# Retroactive Task Documentation

## Learning
Add completed tasks to TODO.md even if they weren't originally planned, to maintain a complete project history. This ensures TODO.md serves as a comprehensive record of all significant work, not just pre-planned tasks.

## Importance
Creates a complete audit trail of project work, enables accurate progress tracking, and helps identify patterns in unplanned work that might inform future planning.

## Example
```markdown
// Task wasn't originally in TODO.md, but after completion:
### CHANGELOG.md Compaction (Completed 2025-08-03 Part 3)
- [x] Compacted CHANGELOG.md from 1637 lines to 902 lines (45% reduction)
- [x] Preserved all key metrics, dates, and technology transitions
- [x] Combined related bullet points with semicolons for better readability
- [x] Maintained chronological order and milestone significance
```

```markdown
// Discovered and fixed bug during other work:
### Critical Build System Fix (Completed 2025-07-28)
- [x] Fixed Makefile test targets to properly propagate failures
- [x] Fixed false positive SUCCESS reporting in build script
- [x] All test targets now exit with non-zero code on failure
```

## Generalization
**When to add retroactively**:
- Unplanned but significant work (>30 minutes)
- Emergency fixes or hotfixes
- Work discovered during other tasks
- User-requested changes not in original plan
- Refactoring that emerged from implementation

**What to include**:
- Clear task description
- Completion date with part number if multiple per day
- Specific achievements with metrics
- All subtasks marked as completed [x]

**Benefits**:
- Complete project history
- Pattern identification for future planning
- Accurate time/effort tracking
- Documentation for future reference

## Implementation
1. **After completing unplanned work**: Immediately document before context is lost
2. **Use consistent format**: Match existing TODO.md structure
3. **Add to Completed Tasks section**: With appropriate date/part designation
4. **Include specific details**: Metrics, file names, impact
5. **Mark all items as complete**: Use [x] checkboxes

**Format template**:
```markdown
### Task Description (Completed YYYY-MM-DD [Part N])
- [x] Specific achievement with metrics
- [x] Another completed subtask
- [x] Final result or impact statement
```

**Part numbering**: Use "Part 2", "Part 3" etc. for multiple significant tasks on same date
