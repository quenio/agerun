# Functional Value Validation Pattern

## Learning
Before keeping any feature or enhancement, validate that it provides actual functional value beyond decoration or perceived clarity. Features that don't change behavior, improve performance, or enable new capabilities should be removed.

## Importance
Decorative features increase complexity without benefit. They add maintenance burden, increase cognitive load, and can obscure the actual purpose of code. Every feature should earn its place by providing measurable value.

## Example
```bash
# Role statements seemed helpful for clarity:
**Role: DevOps Engineer**
Execute build verification...

# But validation revealed they provided no value:
# - Didn't change how commands execute
# - Didn't provide context beyond the description
# - Just decorative labels

# Solution: Remove entirely rather than improve
for file in .claude/commands/*.md; do
    sed -i '/^\*\*Role:/d' "$file"
done
```

Real AgeRun example of functional vs non-functional:
```c
// Functional: Error logging that helps debugging
if (!ref_filename) {
    ar_log__error(mut_reader->ref_log, "NULL filename provided");
    return NULL;
}

// Non-functional: Comments that repeat the code
ar_data_t* data = ar_data__create_string("test");  // Create a string
```

## Generalization
Apply functional value validation to all features:
1. **Before adding**: "How does this change behavior or enable new capabilities?"
2. **During review**: "What would break if we removed this?"
3. **When questioned**: "Can I demonstrate the value, not just explain it?"
4. **During refactoring**: "Is this earning its complexity cost?"

## Implementation
```bash
# Questions to validate functional value:
echo "Functional Value Checklist:"
echo "1. Does it change execution behavior? (not just appearance)"
echo "2. Does it enable something previously impossible?"
echo "3. Does it prevent errors or improve reliability?"
echo "4. Does it improve performance measurably?"
echo "5. Would removing it break anything?"

# If all answers are "no", remove the feature
```
