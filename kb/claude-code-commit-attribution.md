# Claude Code Commit Attribution

## Learning
All commits created by Claude Code should include a standardized footer with attribution and co-authorship to provide transparency about AI-assisted development and maintain proper attribution in the git history.

## Importance
Transparency in development practices is essential for understanding project history, evaluating contributions, and maintaining trust. Marking AI-assisted commits allows future developers to understand the context of changes and helps organizations track how AI tools are being used in development.

## Example
```bash
# Creating a commit with proper Claude Code attribution

git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat: integrate proxy registry into system (TDD Cycle 4.5)

Integrate ar_delegate_registry into ar_system following the established
ar_agency pattern. System now owns and manages the proxy registry with
proper lifecycle handling and ownership semantics.

Implementation Details:
- RED Phase: Added stubs returning NULL/false causing assertion failures
- GREEN Phase: Added own_proxy_registry field to ar_system_s
- REFACTOR Phase: 2 new tests pass with zero leaks (527 allocations)

Modified Files:
- modules/ar_system.h: Added ar_system__get_delegate_registry()
- modules/ar_system.c: Added registry field and lifecycle management
- modules/ar_system_tests.c: Added 2 BDD-style tests

Test Results: 77 tests passing, zero memory leaks, 1m 31s build time

## Generalization
**Standard Attribution Footer Format:**

```
ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Placement:**
- At the very end of commit message
- After blank line following main commit content
- Before any trailers (Signed-off-by, etc.)

**When to Use:**
- âœ“ Commits created by Claude Code
- âœ“ Code written by Claude Code
- âœ“ Documentation generated by Claude Code
- âœ“ Refactorings performed by Claude Code
- âœ— Manual commits by human developers (obviously)
- âœ— Commits where human only used Claude Code for consultation

**Commit Message Structure with Attribution:**
```
<type>: <short description>

<longer description paragraph 1>

## Implementation
```bash
# Using HEREDOC for proper formatting (REQUIRED)
# This ensures blank lines and special characters are preserved

git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

# DO NOT use simple string quotes (formatting breaks):
# git commit -m "feat: ...\n\nðŸ¤– Generated..."  # WRONG

# DO NOT forget the attribution footer
# DO NOT modify the footer format (standardization)
```

## Real Example from Commit Workflow
From AgeRun's `/ar:commit` command (Step 8: Create Commit):

```bash
# Checkpoint 8: Create Commit
make checkpoint-update CMD=commit STEP=8

# Create commit with proper attribution
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat: integrate proxy registry into system (TDD Cycle 4.5)

Integrate ar_delegate_registry into ar_system following the established ar_agency
pattern. System now owns and manages the proxy registry with proper lifecycle
handling and ownership semantics.

Implementation Details:
- RED Phase: Added stubs returning NULL/false causing assertion failures
- GREEN Phase: Added own_proxy_registry field to ar_system_s, updated lifecycle
- REFACTOR Phase: 2 new tests pass with zero leaks (527 allocations)

Modified Files:
- modules/ar_system.h: Added ar_system__get_delegate_registry(), register_proxy()
- modules/ar_system.c: Added registry field, lifecycle management
- modules/ar_system_tests.c: Added test_system__has_proxy_registry(), register

Test Results: 77 tests passing, zero memory leaks, 1m 31s build time

## Attribution Benefits
1. **Transparency**: Clear about AI assistance
2. **Traceability**: Can filter commits by AI vs human
3. **Context**: Future developers understand tooling used
4. **Metrics**: Organizations can track AI tool usage
5. **Trust**: Honest about development practices

## GitHub Co-Author Recognition
The `Co-Authored-By` trailer is recognized by GitHub:
- Shows Claude as a co-author on the commit
- Commit appears in contribution graph for both human and AI
- Allows filtering by co-author in GitHub UI
