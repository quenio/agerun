# Claude Code Commit Attribution

## Learning
**DEPRECATED**: This pattern is no longer used. Commit messages should NOT include Claude Code attribution footers.

## Status
- ❌ **DO NOT** include attribution footers in commit messages
- ❌ **DO NOT** add "🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)"
- ❌ **DO NOT** add "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

## Current Practice
Commit messages should contain only the actual commit content:
- Commit type and description
- Detailed explanation of changes
- Implementation details
- Modified files
- Test results

**No attribution footers should be included.**
