# Command Documentation Excellence Gate

## Learning
All Claude Code command documentation must achieve 90%+ structure scores or the CI build fails. This enforces documentation quality at the build level, preventing degradation over time.

## Importance
Documentation quality directly impacts developer productivity. By enforcing excellence scores (90%+) as a hard CI gate, we ensure all commands maintain comprehensive structure with checkpoints, gates, examples, and quality indicators.

## Example
```python
# In check_commands.py - enforcing excellence as CI gate
def main():
    # Calculate scores for all commands
    excellent, good, needs_work, poor = categorize_scores(scores)
    
    # Exit with error if any command is not excellent
    non_excellent = needs_work + poor + good
    if non_excellent > 0:
        print(f"\n‚ùå Structure validation failed: {non_excellent} commands are not excellent (90%+ required)")
        print(f"Commands must achieve excellent scores to ensure quality and consistency.")
        sys.exit(1)  # Non-zero exit code fails the build
```

## Generalization
Quality gates should be enforced programmatically in CI pipelines. Set measurable criteria (like 90% score thresholds) and fail builds when standards aren't met. This prevents gradual quality degradation.

## Implementation
```bash
# In build.sh - running as parallel job
run_job "check-commands" "make check-commands" "logs/check-commands.log"

# The make target runs validation
make check-commands  # Exits 1 if any command < 90%
```

## Quality Enhancement Pattern

Commands should extract complex embedded bash logic to helper scripts for better maintainability and testability:

```markdown
## Bad: Embedded 30-line verification logic
\`\`\`bash
for file in modules/*.c; do
  # ... complex logic ...
done
\`\`\`

## Good: Extract to helper script
**Helper script available:**
\`\`\`bash
./scripts/verify-module-quality.sh [path]
\`\`\`
```

This improves command documentation scores by:
- Reducing command file size and complexity
- Making verification logic testable
- Enabling reuse across commands
